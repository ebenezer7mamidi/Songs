That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing

And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration

Thine own pure love we measure,

  All terror from our breasts.

VerseOrder: v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1
Chorus1 : O love of God, how rich and pure!
  How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure—
    The saints’ and angels’ song.
1. The love of God is greater far
  Than tongue or pen can ever tell.
It goes beyond the highest star
  And reaches to the lowest hell.
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
  God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled
  And pardoned from his sin.
2. When hoary time shall pass away,
  And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
  On rocks and hills and mountains call;
God’s love, so sure, shall still endure,
  All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race—
  The saints’ and angels’ song.
3. Could we with ink the ocean fill,
  And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
  And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
  Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
  Though stretched from sky to sky.

Still march in firm array,
As warriors through the darkness toil,
Till dawns the golden day.

by which supported still we stand;
the opening year thy mercy shows;

and seal in silence mortal tongues,
our helper God, in whom we trust,
shall keep our souls and guard our dust.

Reserved for sinners saved by grace;
’Tis sacred to one class alone
And touched by one peculiar race.

How mercy flows in Jesus’ blood,
It is not theirs to prove, as we,
The cleansing virtue of this flood.

Death and the curse are known no more;

	  Christ Son of God, And Christ in Kingly Reign.
	  So through the ages, since the song began, 
	  With swelling hosts, the saints repeat the strain.

2. On hills and plains the Israelite only knew,
On classic soil, on drifting desert sand,
Where'er the Roman eagles swiftly flew, 
Or roamed abroad the fierce ungoverned band; 
'Mong Jew and Gentile, as in wandering horde,
Barbarian, Scythian, all, the bond or free— 
There were who watched and waited for the Lord, 
And some who did His mighty wonders see.
3. How from the warm and ever-ruddy East, 
Far to the rugged North and golden West, 
The knowledge of this wondrous Christ increased, 
With life and hope the dying nations blessed: 
Thence saints, exultant, onward bore His sign 
From land to land, and compassed every shore ; 
One Lord, one faith, one aim, one end divine. 
Their theme and song, their life for evermore!
4. Since holy women bowed their heads and wept, 
Where from the grave the angel rolled the stone— 
That grave where He, the Son of God, had slept 
As Son of Man, in darkness and alone— 
What countless names the world's applause have won!
What notes of praise have men to these inscribed!
How soon were they forgotten, one by one. 
And earth's poor honors to the dead denied!
5. Not mightiest kings the earth has ever seen. 
Nor time, nor powers men honored or abhorred. 
Could crush the memory of the Nazarene, 
Or shut the saints from presence of their Lord: 
In kingly courts, in prisons foul and damp. 
In scenes tumultuous, as in homes of peace. 
There, with His own, God's Angel would encamp. 
There rise the songs that nevermore shall cease !
6. Thus through the years of ages long ago. 
Thus in the changes of these latter days: 
One only Lord, our Lord, above, below. 
And He the object op our endless praise: 
This the same key-note of unnumbered lyres, 
This, too, th' unending song of sweet accord. 
O world! ye have no theme that thus inspires: 
Ye still reject and crucify the Lord.
7. In furnace-fires, on mountains drear and cold  
In peasant hut, as in the pahice-hall, 
The story of His life for ever told, 
And His dear love the burning theme of all  
From lips too weak aught human to express. 
From noble hearts that held the world at bay. 
What songs have risen, and what strains confess 
The blessed One whom I would praise today!
8. Christ Son of God, and Christ the Son of Man ; 
Christ on the Cross, and Christ in kingly Reign!
So sang the saints when first the song began. 
So shall it rise a never-ending strain. 
Come, Thou, and touch my lips, that I may sing; 
Come, fill my heart with love to overfiow: 
My Lord, my Life, I would some tribute bring, 
And tell the world how much to Thee I owe!

"Come down from the cursed tree;"

But all my iniquity 
My God laid on Him that awful day, 
When, bearing my sins, He died for me.
6. Oh, thanks for the love that brought Him down. 
Love, fathomless, like the sea; 
His brow was pierced by a thorny crown. 
That a crown of life might be given me.
7. My brother, behold Him, crucified, 
On the cross of Calvary; 
Thy ransom see in that crimson tide; 
Oh freely it flowed for you and me.

My surety on the tree;
The Lamb of God, the Sacrifice,
He gave Himself for me!

The wormwood and the gall,
There, in that lone mysterious hour,

Nor other tell Thy joy’s full tide
That from that cup shall flow.

And this the new and endless song,
Thy love to us—to me!

  Our load was laid on Thee;
Thou stoodest in the sinner’s stead,
  Didst bear all ill for me.
A victim led; Thy blood was shed;
  Now there’s no load for me.
2. Death and the curse were in our cup,
  O Christ, ’twas full for Thee!
But Thou hast drained the last dark drop—
  ’Tis empty now for me.
That bitter cup—love drank it up;
  Now blessings’ draught for me.
3. Jehovah lifted up His rod,
  O Christ, it fell on Thee!
Thou wast sore stricken of Thy God;
  There’s not one stroke for me.
Thy tears, Thy blood, beneath it flowed;
  Thy bruising healeth me.
4. The tempest’s awful voice was heard,
  O Christ, it broke on Thee!
Thy open bosom was my ward,
  It braved the storm for me.
Thy form was scarred, Thy visage marred;
  Now cloudless peace for me.
5. Jehovah bade His sword awake,
  O Christ, it woke ’gainst Thee!
Thy blood the flaming blade must slake;
  Thy heart its sheath must be—
All for my sake, my peace to make;
  Now sleeps that sword for me.
6. For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
  And I have died in Thee;
Thou’rt ris’n: my bands are all untied,
  And now Thou liv’st in me.
When purified, made white, and tried,

That sinners might from sin be freed.
2. Himself He could not save,

In love Himself He gave,
  There ne’er was love like His!
Such love should melt a heart of stone,
Till praise flows forth to Him alone!

Love's stream too deeply flowed,
In love Himself He gave,
To pay the debt we owed.
Obedience to His Father's will,
And love to Him did all fulfil.

And drink of mercy free,
Of mercy now so richly shed,

VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4
1. O Joyful day! O glorious hour!
When Jesus, by almighty power,
Revived and left the grave;
In all His works behold Him great,
Before, almighty to create,
Before, almighty to create,
Almighty now to save.
2. The First-begotten from the dead,
He's risen now, His people's Head,
And thus their life's secure;
And if, like Him, they yield their breath,
Like Him they'll burst the bonds of death,
Like Him they'll burst the bonds of death,
Their resurrection sure.
3. Why should His people,then, be sad?
None have such reason to be glad
As those redeemed to God:
Jesus, the mighty Saviour, lives,
To them eternal life He gives,
To them eternal life He gives,
The purchase of His blood.
4. Then let our gladsome praise resound,
And let us in His work abound,
Whose blessed name is Love;
We're sure our labour's not in vain,
For we with Him ere long shall reign-
For we with Him ere long shall reign-
With Jesus dwell above.

Christ the Lord, the living One!
All His toil on earth completed,
All His work for sinners done.
In the glory, in the glory,
See Him—God’s eternal Son!

Every tongue confess His name,
Ransomed myriads shall adore Him,
Who endured the sinner’s shame!
From the glory, from the glory,
God doth now His worth proclaim.

Man, the Savior crucified;
This world’s judgment stands recorded.
God’s own justice satisfied!

Opened first the tale of grace;
Son of Man, in new creation
Leader of a chosen race!
Well may glory, well may glory,
Give to Him the honored place!

1. My King will soon come back again,
 	 	The sky be filled with Him;
 	The universe to be redeemed
 	 	Will see His light therein.
 	The Lord will soon fulfill His plan,
 	 	His footsteps now I hear;
 	His glorious frame I faintly see
 	 	Beginning to appear.
2. I’m longing for His presence blest
 	 	And dare not slothful be
 	While waiting for my Lord’s return,
 	 	His own dear self to see.
 	My only hope-that He may come
 	 	And change my faith to sight;
 	There is no other joy on earth
 	 	Which gives my heart delight
3. My heart is always with Himself,
 	 	My eyes are heavenward,
 	My lips would utter nothing else
 	 	Than meeting with my Lord.
 	The coming of the Lord draws nigh,
 	 	His coming is for me;
 	His promise ever standeth firm
 	 	And soon fulfilled I’ll see.
4. My Savior, all Thy holy words
 	 	Can never doubted be;
 	With them encouraged day by day,
 	 	I’m faithful unto Thee.
 	Oh, may Thy glory soon appear,
 	 	The foe be overthrown;
 	Thy promises be realized,
 	 	And we brought to Thy throne.
5. Thy saving arm a refuge is,
 	 	My Savior God, to me;
 	Thou as the Father keepeth them
 	 	Who put their trust in Thee.
 	The sheep and shepherd are of one,
 	 	The head and body same;
 	None e’er can pluck from out Thy hand
 	 	The child who trusts Thy Name.
6. A thousand hands won’t hinder me,
 	 	Nor will ten thousand eyes;
 	The thorns upon the road but help
 	 	Me onward to the prize.
 	Arise, my spirit and my heart,
 	 	And let the world go by;
 	The Lord of life will take me soon
 	 	To be with Him on high.
7. Thou healing sun! Thou hope of man!
 	 	I really love Thy ray.
 	Oh, righteous Lord! oh, glorious King!
 	 	I bow to Thee and pray:
 	Oh, may Thou soon ascend Thy throne
 	 	And quickly show Thy face;
 	Thy heav’nly kingdom may Thou found
 	 	And grant all men Thy grace.
8. The truth should triumph and be king,
 	 	And freedom should be queen;
 	But falsehood, which has rampant run,
 	 	Head of the world be seen.
 	We ask Thee, Truth, to quickly come
 	 	And bring Thy light from heav’n;
 	The foe be crushed and all Thy sons
 	 	Into Thy bosom giv’n.

And still in loneliness she waits,
  A friendless stranger she.
  Age after age has gone,
  Sun after sun has set,
And still in weeds of widowhood,
  She weeps a mourner yet.
2. Saint after saint on earth
  Has lived, and loved, and died;
And as they left us one by one,
  We laid them side by side;
  We laid them down to sleep,
  But not in hope forlorn;
We laid them but to ripen there,
  Till the last glorious morn.
3. The serpent’s brood increase,
  The powers of hell grow bold,
The conflict thickens, faith is low,
  And love is waxing cold.
  How long, O Lord our God,
  Holy, and true, and good,
Wilt Thou not judge Thy suffering Church,
  Her sighs, and tears, and blood?
4. We long to hear Thy voice,
  To see Thee face to face,
To share Thy crown and glory then,
  As now we share Thy grace.
  Should not the loving bride
  Her absent bridegroom mourn?
Should she not wear the signs of grief
  Until her Lord return?
5. The whole creation groans,
  And waits to hear that voice
That shall her beauteousness restore,
  And make her wastes rejoice.
  Come, Lord, and wipe away
  The curse, the sin, the stain,
And make this blighted world of ours

Chorus1 : Come Thou, come now;

 	 	All our desire is Thy promised returning,
 	 	Oh, may Thou quickly return.
1. Since Thy departure from Olivet’s Mountain,
 	 	Why is Thy coming again so delayed?
 	Thru the long years we have longed for Thy coming;
 	 	Hast Thou not heard all the prayers that we’ve prayed?
2. Beloved Lord, since the year Thou ascended
 	 	Everything here has been tasteless and dry;
 	Often in praying and often in watching,
 	 	In every movement, for Thee, Lord, we sigh.
3. Scenes although lovely, yet when will we meet Thee?
 	 	Birds and the flowers fair beauty embrace;
 	All are delightsome, but none satisfy me,
 	 	For I am longing for Thy loving face.
4. Lord, we’re impatient awaiting Thy coming,
 	 	We do not know how much longer ‘twill be;
 	From every sunrise to every bright sunset
 	 	Hope we each moment Thy coming to see.
5. Whene’er ‘tis raining, or strong winds are blowing,
 	 	Whene’er the moon shines, or rises the sea,
 	We ever hope to discover Thy coming;
 	 	How disappointed when no sign of Thee!
6. If it were not for the bidding Thou gav’st us,
 	 	We’d be discouraged, Thy service we’d shirk;
 	But Thou dost want us while waiting Thy coming,
 	 	For Thee to live and in diligence work.
7. Oh Lord, remember the days have been lengthened
 	 	Since Thou hast promised ere going away;
 	We hope and hope and are endlessly hoping,
 	 	That Thou wilt come. Canst Thou come e’en today?

1. Since long ago at Bethany we parted,
 	Within my heart there is a ceaseless void;
 	How can I take my harp down from the willow?
 	How can my songs without Thee be enjoyed?
 	And when at night I’m keeping lonely vigil-
 	Grown numb alike to sorrow and to cheer-
 	Then I recall the promise of Thy coming,
 	But sigh: O Lord, why, why Thou dost not yet appear?
2. Thy manger wakes the thought: I too am homeless;
 	Thy cross strips earthly pleasures from my soul;
 	Thy coming bids me seek a better country,
 	For Thou Thyself art now my final goal.
 	Since Thou art gone my joy has lost its flavor,
 	My song the sweetness I would fain convey.
 	Since Thou art gone the sense of void o’erwhelms me.
 	Oh, how I long that Thou wilt come and not delay.
3. Though even now I know Thy loving presence,
 	Yet in my heart there’s still a sense of lack.
 	Enlightening and tenderest sustaining
 	Can no more satisfy: I want Thee back.
 	Despite Thy peace within, I still feel lonely;
 	Despite Thy joy there still remains a sigh;
 	When I feel most content, the silent yearning
 	To see Thee face to face becomes an uttered cry.
4. What exile cannot but desire his homeland
 	And long his people once again to greet?
 	What soul on alien soil forgets his kindred?
 	What parted lovers never yearn to meet?
 	O Lord, how can these earthly loves and pleasures
 	With all the joy of Thy return compare?
 	Then, if I cannot here behold Thy countenance,
 	What can I do but sigh till Thou, my Lord, appear?
5. Could’st Thou, O Lord, forget Thy word of promise
 	Soon to return and take me unto Thee?
 	Yet day by day and year by year I’ve waited
 	And still I wait, and no return I see!
 	Remember, Lord, the years I have been waiting
 	While Thy dear footsteps linger far away.
 	How long? How long? Oh! must I wait still longer
 	Till Thou shalt come again in glorious array?
6. From generation unto generation
 	Thy saints have come and gone, but have not seen
 	Thy glorious promise pass into fulfilment.
 	How long, how very long the time has been!
 	Why cannot we, dear Lord, discern Thy footsteps?
 	Why are the heavens still so closely sealed?
 	Oh! must our waiting be prolonged still further
 	Before Thou in Thy matchless splendor art revealed?
7. Lord, I recall the many years I’ve waited
 	For Thy return-yet, Lord, not I alone,
 	But Thy dear saints through many generations-
 	Beseeching Thee to come back for Thine own.
 	To countless tears and countless fervent pleadings,
 	By Thine appearing haste to make reply.
 	Oh, may Thou come, the echo of the ages,
 	Come, come and answer now this mighty corp’rate cry!

Weary was our heart with waiting, and
  the night-watch seemed so long,
But His triumph-day is breaking, and

2. In the fading of the starlight we can
  see the coming morn;
And the lights of men are paling in

For the eastern skies are glowing as
  with lights of hidden fire,
And the hearts of men are stirring
  with the throb of deep desire.
3. There’s a hush of expectation, and
  a quiet in the air;
And the breath of God is moving in
  the fervent breath of prayer;
For the suffering, dying Jesus is the
  Christ upon the throne,
And the travail of our spirit is the
  travail of His own.
4. He is breaking down the barriers,
  He is casting up the way;
He is calling for His angels to build
  up the gates of day;
But His angels here are human, not
  the shining hosts above,
For the drum-beats of His army are
  the heart-beats of our love.
5. Hark! we hear a distant music, and
  it comes with fuller swell;
’Tis the triumph song of Jesus, of

VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7
1. How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
  In a believer’s ear!
It soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds,
  And drives away his fear,
  And drives away his fear,
  And drives away his fear,
It soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds,
  And drives away his fear.
2. It makes the wounded spirit whole,
  And calms the troubled breast;
’Tis manna to the hungry soul,
  And to the weary rest,
  And to the weary rest,
  And to the weary rest,
’Tis manna to the hungry soul,
  And to the weary rest.
3. Dear Name! the Rock on which we build;
  Our shield and hiding-place;
Our never-failing treasury, filled
  With boundless stores of grace,
  With boundless stores of grace,
  With boundless stores of grace,
Our never-failing treasury, filled
  With boundless stores of grace.
4. By Thee, my prayers acceptance gain,
Although with sin defiled;
Satan accuses me in vain,
And I am owned a child.
And I am owned a child.
And I am owned a child.
Satan accuses me in vain,
And I am owned a child.
5. Jesus, our Savior, Shepherd, Friend,
  Our Prophet, Priest, and King;
Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End,
  Accept the praise we bring,
  Accept the praise we bring,
  Accept the praise we bring,
Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End,
  Accept the praise we bring.
6. Weak is the effort of our heart,
  And cold our warmest thought;
But when we see Thee as Thou art,
  We’ll praise Thee as we ought,
  We’ll praise Thee as we ought,
  We’ll praise Thee as we ought,
But when we see Thee as Thou art,
  We’ll praise Thee as we ought.
7. Till then we would Thy love proclaim
  With every fleeting breath;
And triumph in that blessed Name
  Which quells the pow’r of death,
  Which quells the pow’r of death,
  Which quells the pow’r of death,
And triumph in that blessed Name
  Which quells the pow’r of death.

And that’s the reason why I love Him so;
Oh, Jesus is the sweetest name I know.
1. There have been names that I have loved to hear,

SongTitle: My song is love unknown
VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7
1. My song is love unknown,
  My Savior’s love to me;
Love to the loveless shown,
  That they might lovely be.
    O who am I,
    That for my sake
    My Lord should take
    Frail flesh, and die?
2. He came from His blest throne
  Salvation to bestow;
But men made strange, and none
  The longed-for Christ would know:
    But oh, my Friend,
    My Friend indeed,
    Who at my need
    His life did spend.
3. Sometimes they strew His way,
  And His sweet praises sing;
Resounding all the day
  Hosannas to their King:
    Then “Crucify!”
    Is all their breath,
    And for His death
    They thirst and cry.
4. Why? What hath my Lord done?
What makes this rage and spite?
He made the lame to run,
He gave the blind their sight.
Sweet injuries!
Yet they at these
Themselves thy please,
And 'gainst Him rise.
5. They rise and needs will have
  My dear Lord made away;
A murderer they save,
  The Prince of life they slay.
    Yet cheerful He
    To suffering goes,
    That He His foes
    From thence might free.
6. In life, no house, no home
  My Lord on earth might have;
In death, no friendly tomb,
  But what a stranger gave.
    What may I say?
    Heav’n was His home;
    But mine the tomb
    Wherein He lay.
7. Here might I stay and sing,
  No story so divine;
Never was love, dear King,
  Never was grief like Thine.
    This is my Friend,
    In whose sweet praise
    I all my days
    Could gladly spend.

Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;
I tremble to know that for me He was crucified,
That for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled and died.
2. I marvel that He would descend from His throne divine
To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;
That He should extend His great love unto such as I,
Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.

Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?
No, no! I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,
And testify all my desires He doth fully meet.

  Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
  A sinner condemned, unclean.
2. For me it was in the garden,
  He prayed: “Not my will, but Thine.”
He had no tears for His own griefs,
  But sweat-drops of blood for mine.
3. In pity angels beheld Him,
  And came from the world of light
To strengthen Him in the sorrows
  He bore for my soul that night.
4. He took my sins and my sorrows,
  He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv’ry,

He makes me triumph over death,

Is more than all the world to me:
’Tis higher than the heights above,
And deeper than the soundless sea;
    So old, so new,
    So strong, so true;
Before the earth received its frame,
He loved me—Blessed be His name!
2. He held the highest place above,
Adored by all the sons of flame,
Yet such His self-denying love,
He laid aside His crown and came
    To seek the lost,
    And at the cost
Of heavenly rank and earthly fame
He sought me—Blessed be His name!
3. It was a lonely path He trod,
From every human soul apart;
Known only to Himself and God
Was all the grief that filled His heart,
    Yet from the track
    He turned not back,
Till where I lay in want and shame,
He found me—Blessed be His name!
4. Then dawned at last that day of dread,
When desolate, yet undismayed,
With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,
He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,
    Was then made sin
    On Calvary,
And, dying there in grief and shame,
He saved me—Blessed be His name!
5. Long as I live my song shall tell
The wonders of His dying love;
And when at last I go to dwell
With Him His sovereign grace to prove,
    My joy shall be
    His face to see,
And bowing there with loud acclaim
I’ll praise Him—Blessed be His name!

The fulness of Thy love, while here below,
My empty vessel I may freely bring;
O Thou, who art of love the living spring,

5. I am an empty vessel—not one thought
Or look of love to Thee I’ve ever brought;
Yet I may come, and come again to Thee,
With this the empty sinner’s only plea,

SongTitle: One there is, above all others
VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6
1. One there is, above all others,
well deserves the name of Friend;
his is love beyond a brother's,
costly, free, and knows no end.
They who once his kindness prove
find it everlasting love.
2. Which of all our friends, to save us,
could or would have shed his blood?
But our Jesus died to have us
reconciled in him to God.
This was boundless love indeed;
Jesus is a Friend in need.
3. Men, when raised to lofty stations,
Often know their friends no more;
Slight and scorn their poor relations
Though they valued them before.
But our Savior always owns
Those whom He redeemed with groans.
4. When he lived on earth abased,
"Friend of sinners" was his name.
Now above all glory raised,
he rejoices in the same;
still he calls them brethren, friends,
and to all their wants attends.
5. Could we bear from one another
what he daily bears from us?
Yet this glorious Friend and Brother
loves us, though we treat him thus:
though for good we render ill,
he accounts us brethren still.
6. O for grace our hearts to soften!
Teach us, Lord, at length to love;
we, alas! forget too often
what a Friend we have above:
but when home our souls are brought,
we will love you as we ought.

1. O Love divine, how sweet Thou art,
When shall I find my willing heart
  All taken up by Thee?
My thirsty spirit faints to prove
The greatness of redeeming love,
  The love of Christ to me.
2. Stronger His love than death and hell,
Its riches are unsearchable:
  The first-born sons of light
Desire in vain its depths to see;
They cannot reach the mystery,
  The length, and breadth, and height.
3. God only knows the love of God;
Oh, that it now were shed abroad
  In this poor stony heart;
For love I sigh, for love I pine;
This only portion, Lord, be mine,
  Be mine this better part.
4. Oh, that I could forever sit
Like Mary, at the Master’s feet;
  Be this my happy choice;
My only care, delight, and bliss,
My joy, my rest on earth be this,
  To hear the Bridegroom’s voice.
5. O that I could, with favored John,
Recline my weary head upon
The dear Redeemer’s breast!
From care, and sin, and sorrow free,
Give me, O Lord, to find in Thee
My everlasting rest.

No Thought Can Reach, No Tongue Declare;
O Knit My Thankful Heart To Thee,

Thine Wholly, Thine Alone, I Am,
Lord, with Thy love my heart in-flame.
2. O Grant That Nothing In My Soul
May Dwell, But Thy Pure Love Alone;
O May Thy Love Possess Me Whole,
My Joy, My Treasure, And My Crown!
Strange Flames Far From My Heart Remove;
My Every Act, Word, Thought, Be Love.
3. O Love, How Cheering Is Thy Ray!
All Pain Before Thy Presence Flies,
Care, Anguish, Sorrow, Melt Away,
Where’er Thy Healing Beams Arise;
O Jesu, Nothing May I See,
And naught desire, Or Seek, But Thee!
4. Still Let Thy Love Point Out My War;
How Wondrous Things Thy Love Hath Wrought!
Still Lead Me, Lest I Go Astray;
Direct My Word, Inspire My Thought;
And If I Fall, Soon May I Hear
Thy Voice, And Know That Love Is Near.
5. In Suffering Be Thy Love My Peace,
In Weakness Be Thy Love My Power;
And When The Storms Of Life Shall Cease,
Jesus, In That eventful Hour,
In Death As Life Be Guide and Friend,
That I may love Thee without end.

2. Jesus for thou a body takes,
Thy guilt assumes, thy fetters breaks,
Discharging all thy dreadful debt;

And fly to this most sure relief;
Nor Him forget, who left His throne,
And for thy life gave up His own.

	  He loves unto the end.
3. Unto the end; we doubt Him, we deny Him,

	  Without one faint regret.

3. Blow, winds of God, awake and blow
The mists of earth away:
Shine out, O light divine, and show
How wide and far we stray.
4. We may not climb the heavenly steeps
To bring the Lord Christ down;
In vain we search the lowest deeps,
For Him no depths can drown.
5. But warm, sweet, tender, even yet,
A present help is He;
And faith still has its Olivet,
And love its Galilee.
6. The healing of His seamless dress
Is by our beds of pain;
We touch Him in life’s throng and press,
And we are whole again.
7. Through Him the first fond prayers are said
Our lips of childhood frame,
The last low whispers of our dead

In that which ever speaks to Him of Thee,

When Thou shalt be of every tongue the theme,
Let this small vessel prove Thy gracious power
To fill and satisfy it every hour.

Surpassing far the fairest joys of earth,
Shall then absorb its true and constant love,
Thyself its Object in those scenes above.

Chorus1 : For the lion of Judah
shall break every chain,
And give us the vict’ry,
again and again.
1. ‘Twas Jesus, my Saviour,
who died on the tree,
To open a fountain
for sinners like me;
His blood is that fountain
which pardon bestows,
And cleanses the foulest
wherever it flows.
2. And when I was willing
with all things to part,
He gave me His blessing,
His love in my heart;
So now I am joined
with the conquering band
Who are marching
to glory at Jesus’ command.
3. Though round me the storms
of adversity roll,
And the waves of destruction
encompass my soul;
In vain this frail vessel
the tempest shall toss—
My hope is secure
through the blood of the cross.
4. And when with the ransomed,
by Jesus, my Head,
From fountain to fountain
I then shall be led;
I’ll fall at His feet
and His mercy adore,
And sing Hallelujah
to God evermore.

1. In evil long I took delight,
Unawed by shame or fear,
Till a new object struck my sight,
And stopped my wild career.
2. I saw One hanging on a tree,
In agony and blood,
Who fixed His languid eyes on me,
As near His cross I stood.
3. Sure, never to my latest breath,
Can I forget that look;
It seemed to charge me with His death,
Though not a word He spoke.
4. My conscience felt and owned the guilt,
And plunged me in despair,
I saw my sins His blood had spilt,
And helped to nail Him there.
5. Alas! I knew not what I did,
But now my tears are vain;
Where shall my trembling soul be hid?
For I the Lord have slain.
6. A second look He gave, which said,
I freely all forgive;
This blood is for thy ransom paid;
I die, that thou may’st live.
7. Thus, while His death my sin displays,
In all its blackest hue,
Such is the mystery of grace,
It seals my pardon too.

2. Though the way seems straight and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans and wishes,

Of my heart was set aflame;

  If dark hours about me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
  Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.
5. But, Lord, ’tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!
6. And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.

And claim my answer from the Lord,

  All your plea before the throne;
As you trust, the Lord will whisper,
  “See, my child, the work is done.”

  Each petition, Spirit-wrought;
He will work in wondrous power,
  Far beyond your highest thought.

  In a faith that dares to stand,
Full of joyful expectation,
  With an open, outstretched hand.

  For thy faith-filled, earnest prayer.
Faith delights Him; faith can touch Him,

Than Jesus Christ, my righteousness;

Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,

Oh, may I then in Him be found;
In Him, my righteousness, alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.

When earth seems fairest, and her skies most bright,
Then draw me closer to Thee, lest I rest

Marked by no special joy or grief or strife,
Days filled with quiet duties, trivial care,

So shall the darkest hour with glory shine.
Then when these earthly years have passed away,

What a glory He sheds on our way;
  While we do His good will,

But His smile quickly drives it away;

But our toil He doth richly repay;
  Not a grief or a loss,
  Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

Until all on the altar we lay;
  For the favor He shows,
  And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;

Never fear, only trust and obey.

Look not behind thee, look into His face,
Whose “Come” once uttered, now is past recall.
4. Strong be thy heart, and calm, and glad, and brave!
For angels wonder at thy fearless faith,
And Christ is glad, and men are whispering
Their thanks to God; “Be faithful, yea, to death.”

VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6
1. Long did I toil, and knew no earthly rest;
Far did I rove, and found no certain home;
At last I sought them in His sheltering breast,
Who opes His arms, and bids the weary come.
With Him I found a home, a rest divine;
And I since then am His, and He is mine.
2. Yes, He is mine! and naught of earthly things,
Not all the charms of pleasure, wealth or power,
The fame of heroes, or the pomp of kings,
Could tempt me to forgo His love an hour.
Go, worthless world, I Cry, with all that’s thine!
Go! I my Savior’s arm, and He is mine.
3. The good I have is from His stores supplied,
The ill is only what He deems the best.
He for my Friend, I’m rich with naught beside;
And poor without Him, though of all possessed.
Changes may come—I take, or I resign,
Content, while I am His, while He is mine.
4. Whate’er may change, in Him no change is seen,
A glorious Sun that wanes not nor declines;
Above the clouds and storms He walks serene,
And on His people’s inward darkness shines:
All may depart—I fret not, nor repine,
While I my Savior’s am, while He is mine.
5. He stays me falling; lifts me up hen down;
Reclaims me wandering; guars from every foe;
Plants on my worthless brow the victor’s crown,
Which in return before His feet I throw,
Grieved that I cannot better grace His shrine,
Who deigns to own me His, as He is mine.
6. While here, alas! I know but half His love,
But half discern Him, and but half adore;
But when I meet Him in the realms above,
I hope to love Him better, praise Him more,
And feel, and tell, amid the choir divine,
How fully I am His, and He is mine.

Those ties which naught can sever,

Give us, for Thee long pining,
  To eat till richly filled;
Till, earth’s delights resigning,
  Our every wish is stilled.
2. O Water, life bestowing,
  From out the Savior’s heart,
A fountain purely flowing,
  A fount of love Thou art.
Oh, let us, freely tasting,
  Our burning thirst assuage;
Thy sweetness, never wasting,
  Avails from age to age.
3. Jesus, this feast receiving,
  We Thee unseen adore;
Thy faithful word believing,
  We take, and doubt no more.
Give us, Thou true and loving,
  On earth to live in Thee;
Then, God the veil removing,
  Thy glorious face to see.

But I long to rise in the arms of faith,

  That before Thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,

There are heights of joy that I yet may reach

When love’s “I will” accepted Him forever,

But while here on earth His mercy

  From my thorn, but look for grace,
While within the veil His glory
  Shineth brightly on my face.
4. In the deep dark night, His beauty
  I by faith, not sight, may trace;
He was ridiculed and hated,
  Yet I see His glorious face.
5. Sun and moonlight far surpassing,
  Clouds and Milky Way o’erspread,
Is the glory all transcending
  Shining from His thorn-crowned head.

Chorus1 : Captivated by His beauty,
Worthy tribute haste to bring;
Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
  Crown Him now unrivaled King.
1. Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?
  Is not thine a captured heart?
Chief among ten thousand own Him;
  Joyful choose the better part.
2. Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,
  Lovely things of time and sense;
Gilded thus does sin disarm thee,
  Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.
3. What has stripped the seeming beauty
  From the idols of the earth?
Not a sense of right or duty,
  But the sight of peerless worth.
4. Not the crushing of those idols,
  With its bitter void and smart;
But the beaming of His beauty,
  The unveiling of His heart.
5. Who extinguishes their taper
  Till they hail the rising sun?
Who discards the garb of winter
  Till the summer has begun?
6. ’Tis that look that melted Peter,
  ’Tis that face that Stephen saw,
’Tis that heart that wept with Mary,
  Can alone from idols draw:
7. Draw and win and fill completely,
  Till the cup o’erflow the brim;
What have we to do with idols
  Who have companied with Him?

Beneath the standard of the cross
  The world henceforth shall find me;
I’ve passed in Christ from death to life,
  And left the world behind me.
3. My soul shall ne’er return again
  Back to its former station
For here alone is perfect peace,
  And rest from condemnation;
I’ve made exchange of masters now,
  The vows of glory bind me,
And once for all I’ve left the world,
  Yes, left the world behind me.
4. My choice is made forevermore,
  I want no other Savior;
I ask no purer happiness
  Than His sweet love and favor;
My heart is fixed on Jesus Christ,
  No more the world shall blind me;
I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death,
  And left the world behind me.

 No comeliness I see;
 The one thing needful, dearest Lord,
 Is to be one with thee.
The sense of thy expiring love,
 Into my soul convey;
 Thyself bestow, for thee alone,
 I absolutely pray.
2. Whatever else Thy will withholds,
Here grant me to succeed!
O let Thyself my portion be,
And I am blest indeed!
Less than thyself will not suffice
 My comfort to restore;
 More than thyself I cannot crave,
 And thou canst give no more.
3. Loved of my God, for him again
 With love intense I’d burn;
 Chosen of thee ere time began,
 I choose thee in return.
Whate’er consists not with thy love,
 O teach me to resign;
 I’m rich to all the intents of bliss,
 If thou, O God, art mine.

When I droop in blighting grief.

So full of kindness, love, and gentle grace
But in our hearts we know that Thou art here,

Daily Thy rich forgiveness to bestow.

For comfort look to Thy dear sacrifice;
And, with Thy cross before us, may we find 
Thy genuine image stamped upon our mind,
In constant view!

A loving spirit and a childlike mind;
And from Thy wounds may we receive the power,
Through all life's weal and woe, in every hour,
To cling to Thee.

Like children, finding all our joys in Thee;
And though the tears of sorrow oft must fall, 
Yet, if Thou to our hearts art All in All,
Sweet peace will come.

At the sad sight our tears of grief must flow,
And conscious shame come o'er us as we go.

1. How tedious and tasteless the hours
When Jesus no longer I see!
Sweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flow’rs,
Have all lost their sweetness to me.
The midsummer sun shines but dim,
The fields strive in vain to look gay;
But when I am happy in Him
December’s as pleasant as May.
2. His name yields the richest perfume,
And sweeter than music His voice;
His presence disperses my gloom,
And makes all within me rejoice.
I should, were He always thus nigh,
Have nothing to wish or to fear;
No mortal so happy as I;
My summer would last all the year.
3. Content with beholding His face,
My all to His pleasure resigned;
No changes of season or place,
Would make any change in my mind.
While blessed with a sense of His love,
A palace a toy would appear;
And prisons would palaces prove,
If Jesus would dwell with me there.
4. My Lord, if indeed I am Thine,
If Thou art my sun and my song,
Say, why do I languish and pine?
And why are my winters so long?
Oh, drive these dark clouds from the sky,
Thy soul-cheering presence restore;
Or take me to Thee up on high,
Where winter and clouds are no more.

Aught I could do, or feel to bring me near;
Self effort failed, and I was filled with fear,
And then I found Christ was the only way
That I must come to Him and in Him stay.

Take our portion with thanksgiving,
  Praising for the things He planned.
Satisfaction, full and deepening,

When the heart has tasted Jesus
  Its desires to satisfy,

Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us,

Though amply blessed,
Can never find, although they seek
A perfect rest;
Nor ever shall, until they lean
