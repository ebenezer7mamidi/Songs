And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration

All terror from our breasts.

How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure—
The saints’ and angels’ song.
1. The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell.
It goes beyond the highest star
And reaches to the lowest hell.
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled
And pardoned from his sin.
2. When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call;
God’s love, so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race—
The saints’ and angels’ song.
3. Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky.

Let us our sweetest songs prepare;

Reserved for sinners saved by grace;
’Tis sacred to one class alone
And touched by one peculiar race.

How mercy flows in Jesus’ blood,
It is not theirs to prove, as we,
The cleansing virtue of this flood.

And worship Him as God alone,

And music wakened by supremest love!
How hath it broke from feeble lips and strong.
The power divine, and matchless grace to prove:
Christ Son of God, And Christ in Kingly Reign.
So through the ages, since the song began,
With swelling hosts, the saints repeat the strain.
With swelling hosts, the saints repeat the strain.
2. On hills and plains the Israelite only knew,
On classic soil, on drifting desert sand,
Where'er the Roman eagles swiftly flew,
Or roamed abroad the fierce ungoverned band;
'Mong Jew and Gentile, as in wandering horde,
Barbarian, Scythian, all, the bond or free—
There were who watched and waited for the Lord,
And some who did His mighty wonders see.
3. How from the warm and ever-ruddy East,
Far to the rugged North and golden West,
The knowledge of this wondrous Christ increased,
With life and hope the dying nations blessed:
Thence saints, exultant, onward bore His sign
From land to land, and compassed every shore ;
One Lord, one faith, one aim, one end divine.
Their theme and song, their life for evermore!
4. Since holy women bowed their heads and wept,
Where from the grave the angel rolled the stone—
That grave where He, the Son of God, had slept
As Son of Man, in darkness and alone—
What countless names the world's applause have won!
What notes of praise have men to these inscribed!
How soon were they forgotten, one by one.
And earth's poor honors to the dead denied!
5. Not mightiest kings the earth has ever seen.
Nor time, nor powers men honored or abhorred.
Could crush the memory of the Nazarene,
Or shut the saints from presence of their Lord:
In kingly courts, in prisons foul and damp.
In scenes tumultuous, as in homes of peace.
There, with His own, God's Angel would encamp.
There rise the songs that nevermore shall cease !
6. Thus through the years of ages long ago.
Thus in the changes of these latter days:
One only Lord, our Lord, above, below.
And He the object op our endless praise:
This the same key-note of unnumbered lyres,
This, too, th' unending song of sweet accord.
O world! ye have no theme that thus inspires:
Ye still reject and crucify the Lord.
7. In furnace-fires, on mountains drear and cold
In peasant hut, as in the pahice-hall,
The story of His life for ever told,
And His dear love the burning theme of all
From lips too weak aught human to express.
From noble hearts that held the world at bay.
What songs have risen, and what strains confess
The blessed One whom I would praise today!
8. Christ Son of God, and Christ the Son of Man ;
Christ on the Cross, and Christ in kingly Reign!
So sang the saints when first the song began.
So shall it rise a never-ending strain.
Come, Thou, and touch my lips, that I may sing;
Come, fill my heart with love to overfiow:
My Lord, my Life, I would some tribute bring,
And tell the world how much to Thee I owe!

Today Thy death we show;
In light, eclipsing sun at noon,
Its myst’ry we shall know.

Another arm save Thine to lean upon;

This is the heav’nly table spread for me;
Here let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong
The brief bright hour of fellowship with Thee.

The feast, though not the love, is past and gone;
The bread and wine remove, but Thou art here,
Nearer than ever still our Shield and Sun.

Giving sweet foretastes of the festal joy,

VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6
1. O Christ, what burdens bow’d Thy head!
Our load was laid on Thee;
Thou stoodest in the sinner’s stead,
Didst bear all ill for me.
A victim led; Thy blood was shed;
Now there’s no load for me.
2. Death and the curse were in our cup,
O Christ, ’twas full for Thee!
But Thou hast drained the last dark drop—
’Tis empty now for me.
That bitter cup—love drank it up;
Now blessings’ draught for me.
3. Jehovah lifted up His rod,
O Christ, it fell on Thee!
Thou wast sore stricken of Thy God;
There’s not one stroke for me.
Thy tears, Thy blood, beneath it flowed;
Thy bruising healeth me.
4. The tempest’s awful voice was heard,
O Christ, it broke on Thee!
Thy open bosom was my ward,
It braved the storm for me.
Thy form was scarred, Thy visage marred;
Now cloudless peace for me.
5. Jehovah bade His sword awake,
O Christ, it woke ’gainst Thee!
Thy blood the flaming blade must slake;
Thy heart its sheath must be—
All for my sake, my peace to make;
Now sleeps that sword for me.
6. For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
And I have died in Thee;
Thou’rt ris’n: my bands are all untied,
And now Thou liv’st in me.
When purified, made white, and tried,
Thy glory then for me!

Deeper far than thought can reach;
Grief intense and suff’rings holy,

When redemption’s work was done;
For those suff’rings, deep, unfathomed,

Darkness, wrath and curse were Thine;
Man-betrayed, by God forsaken;

1. Himself He could not save,
He on the cross must die,
Or mercy could not come
To ruined sinners nigh;
Yes, Christ, the Son of God, must bleed,
That sinners might from sin be freed.
2. Himself He could not save,
For justice must be done;
Our sins’ full weight must fall
Upon the sinless One;
For nothing less can God accept
In payment of that fearful debt.
3. Himself He could not save,
For He the Surety stood
For all who now rely
Upon His precious blood;
He bore the penalty of guilt
When on the cross His blood was spilt.
4. Himself He could not save,
What wondrous love is this!
In love Himself He gave,
There ne’er was love like His!
Such love should melt a heart of stone,
Till praise flows forth to Him alone!
5. Himself He could not save,
Love's stream too deeply flowed,
In love Himself He gave,
To pay the debt we owed.
Obedience to His Father's will,
And love to Him did all fulfil.
6. And now exalted high: ---
A Prince and Saviour He,
That sinners might draw nigh
And drink of mercy free,
Of mercy now so richly shed,
For Jesus liveth who was dead.

Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Spreads o’er His body on the tree;
Then I am dead to all the globe,

Joyful Hallelujahs Sing,
And The Portals High Are Lifted

King of glory now;

With love strong as death,
But with awe and wonder,
And with bated breath;

All that is not holy,
All that is not true;
Crown Him as your Captain
In temptation’s hour;
Let His will enfold you
In its light and power.

Shall return again,
With His Father’s glory,
With His angel train;
For all wreaths of empire

Heaven shall smile, and earth shall sing,
Ever yielding rich increase
To the honor of her King.
Send the tidings forth, that all
Humbly at His feet may fall.
4. Hasten, Lord, the wondrous hour,
Bid it strike from shore to shore,
Thine the kingdom and the power,
Thine the glory evermore.
Bow each rebel heart, that all
At Thy feet adoring fall.

Deeply wailing, deeply wailing,

See in solemn pomp appear;
All His saints, by man rejected,
Now shall meet Him in the air:

In silent and shadowy night.

That so their quick ears may be catching.

1. The Church has waited long,
Her absent Lord to see,
And still in loneliness she waits,
A friendless stranger she.
Age after age has gone,
Sun after sun has set,
And still in weeds of widowhood,
She weeps a mourner yet.
2. Saint after saint on earth
Has lived, and loved, and died;
And as they left us one by one,
We laid them side by side;
We laid them down to sleep,
But not in hope forlorn;
We laid them but to ripen there,
Till the last glorious morn.
3. The serpent’s brood increase,
The powers of hell grow bold,
The conflict thickens, faith is low,
And love is waxing cold.
How long, O Lord our God,
Holy, and true, and good,
Wilt Thou not judge Thy suffering Church,
Her sighs, and tears, and blood?
4. We long to hear Thy voice,
To see Thee face to face,
To share Thy crown and glory then,
As now we share Thy grace.
Should not the loving bride
Her absent bridegroom mourn?
Should she not wear the signs of grief
Until her Lord return?
5. The whole creation groans,
And waits to hear that voice
That shall her beauteousness restore,
And make her wastes rejoice.
Come, Lord, and wipe away
The curse, the sin, the stain,
And make this blighted world of ours
Thine own fair world again.

Chorus1 : Come Thou, come now;
Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
All our desire is Thy promised returning,
Oh, may Thou quickly return.
1. Since Thy departure from Olivet’s Mountain,
Why is Thy coming again so delayed?
Thru the long years we have longed for Thy coming;
Hast Thou not heard all the prayers that we’ve prayed?
2. Beloved Lord, since the year Thou ascended
Everything here has been tasteless and dry;
Often in praying and often in watching,
In every movement, for Thee, Lord, we sigh.
3. Scenes although lovely, yet when will we meet Thee?
Birds and the flowers fair beauty embrace;
All are delightsome, but none satisfy me,
For I am longing for Thy loving face.
4. Lord, we’re impatient awaiting Thy coming,
We do not know how much longer ‘twill be;
From every sunrise to every bright sunset
Hope we each moment Thy coming to see.
5. Whene’er ‘tis raining, or strong winds are blowing,
Whene’er the moon shines, or rises the sea,
We ever hope to discover Thy coming;
How disappointed when no sign of Thee!
6. If it were not for the bidding Thou gav’st us,
We’d be discouraged, Thy service we’d shirk;
But Thou dost want us while waiting Thy coming,
For Thee to live and in diligence work.
7. Oh Lord, remember the days have been lengthened
Since Thou hast promised ere going away;
We hope and hope and are endlessly hoping,
That Thou wilt come. Canst Thou come e’en today?

VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7
1. Since long ago at Bethany we parted,
Within my heart there is a ceaseless void;
How can I take my harp down from the willow?
How can my songs without Thee be enjoyed?
And when at night I’m keeping lonely vigil-
Grown numb alike to sorrow and to cheer-
Then I recall the promise of Thy coming,
But sigh: O Lord, why, why Thou dost not yet appear?
2. Thy manger wakes the thought: I too am homeless;
Thy cross strips earthly pleasures from my soul;
Thy coming bids me seek a better country,
For Thou Thyself art now my final goal.
Since Thou art gone my joy has lost its flavor,
My song the sweetness I would fain convey.
Since Thou art gone the sense of void o’erwhelms me.
Oh, how I long that Thou wilt come and not delay.
3. Though even now I know Thy loving presence,
Yet in my heart there’s still a sense of lack.
Enlightening and tenderest sustaining
Can no more satisfy: I want Thee back.
Despite Thy peace within, I still feel lonely;
Despite Thy joy there still remains a sigh;
When I feel most content, the silent yearning
To see Thee face to face becomes an uttered cry.
4. What exile cannot but desire his homeland
And long his people once again to greet?
What soul on alien soil forgets his kindred?
What parted lovers never yearn to meet?
O Lord, how can these earthly loves and pleasures
With all the joy of Thy return compare?
Then, if I cannot here behold Thy countenance,
What can I do but sigh till Thou, my Lord, appear?
5. Could’st Thou, O Lord, forget Thy word of promise
Soon to return and take me unto Thee?
Yet day by day and year by year I’ve waited
And still I wait, and no return I see!
Remember, Lord, the years I have been waiting
While Thy dear footsteps linger far away.
How long? How long? Oh! must I wait still longer
Till Thou shalt come again in glorious array?
6. From generation unto generation
Thy saints have come and gone, but have not seen
Thy glorious promise pass into fulfilment.
How long, how very long the time has been!
Why cannot we, dear Lord, discern Thy footsteps?
Why are the heavens still so closely sealed?
Oh! must our waiting be prolonged still further
Before Thou in Thy matchless splendor art revealed?
7. Lord, I recall the many years I’ve waited
For Thy return-yet, Lord, not I alone,
But Thy dear saints through many generations-
Beseeching Thee to come back for Thine own.
To countless tears and countless fervent pleadings,
By Thine appearing haste to make reply.
Oh, may Thou come, the echo of the ages,
Come, come and answer now this mighty corp’rate cry!

3. Come, for creation groans,
Impatient of Thy stay,
Worn out with these long years of ill,

4. Come, for the good are few;
They lift the voice in vain;
Faith waxes fainter on the earth,

5. Come, for the truth is weak,
And error pours abroad
Its subtle poison o’er the earth—
An earth that hates her God.
6. Come, for love waxes cold,
Its steps are faint and slow;
Faith now is lost in unbelief,
Hope’s lamp burns dim and low.
7. Come, for the corn is ripe,
Put in thy sickle now,
Reap the great harvest of the earth—
Sower and reaper Thou.
8. Come, and make all things new,
Build up this ruined earth;
Restore our faded paradise,
Creation’s second birth.

Of everlasting peace;
Come, take the kingdom to Thyself,
Great King of righteousness.

When our eyes shall see the beauty

Weary was our heart with waiting, and
the night-watch seemed so long,
But His triumph-day is breaking, and
we hail it with a song.
2. In the fading of the starlight we can
see the coming morn;
And the lights of men are paling in
the splendors of the dawn;
For the eastern skies are glowing as
with lights of hidden fire,
And the hearts of men are stirring
with the throb of deep desire.
3. There’s a hush of expectation, and
a quiet in the air;
And the breath of God is moving in
the fervent breath of prayer;
For the suffering, dying Jesus is the
Christ upon the throne,
And the travail of our spirit is the
travail of His own.
4. He is breaking down the barriers,
He is casting up the way;
He is calling for His angels to build
up the gates of day;
But His angels here are human, not
the shining hosts above,
For the drum-beats of His army are
the heart-beats of our love.
5. Hark! we hear a distant music, and
it comes with fuller swell;

4. Why? What hath my Lord done?
What makes this rage and spite?
He made the lame to run,
He gave the blind their sight.
Sweet injuries!
Yet they at these
Themselves thy please,
And 'gainst Him rise.
5. They rise and needs will have
My dear Lord made away;
A murderer they save,
The Prince of life they slay.
Yet cheerful He
To suffering goes,
That He His foes
From thence might free.
6. In life, no house, no home
My Lord on earth might have;
In death, no friendly tomb,
But what a stranger gave.
What may I say?
Heav’n was His home;
But mine the tomb
Wherein He lay.
7. Here might I stay and sing,
No story so divine;
Never was love, dear King,
Never was grief like Thine.
This is my Friend,
In whose sweet praise
I all my days
Could gladly spend.

Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free!
Rolling as a mighty ocean
In its fullness over me!
Underneath me, all around me,
Is the current of Thy love
Leading onward, leading homeward
To Thy glorious rest above!

Spread His praise from shore to shore!
How He loveth, ever loveth,
Changeth never, nevermore!
How He watches o'er His loved ones,
Died to call them all His own;
How for them He intercedeth,
Watcheth o'er them from the throne!

Love of every love the best!

Enough to die for me!
O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!
1. I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,
Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;
I tremble to know that for me He was crucified,
That for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled and died.
2. I marvel that He would descend from His throne divine
To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;
That He should extend His great love unto such as I,
Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.
3. I think of His side, pierced and bleeding to pay the debt,
Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?
No, no! I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,
And testify all my desires He doth fully meet.

How marvelous! How wonderful!
Is my Savior’s love for me!
1. I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned, unclean.
2. For me it was in the garden,
He prayed: “Not my will, but Thine.”
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat-drops of blood for mine.
3. In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To strengthen Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.
4. He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv’ry,
And suffered, and died alone.
5. When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
’Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me.

His head with radiant glories crowned,
His lips with grace o’erflow.
2. No mortal can with Him compare
Among the sons of men;
Fairer is He than all the fair

3. He saw me plunged in deep distress,
and flew to my relief;
for me He bore the shameful cross,
and carried all my grief.
4. To Him I owe my life and breath,
And all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death,
And saves me from the grave.
5. To God, the Father, my abode,

Shows me the glories of my God,
And makes my joys complete.

Such proofs of love divine,

VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5
1. I have a Friend, whose faithful love
Is more than all the world to me:
’Tis higher than the heights above,
And deeper than the soundless sea;
So old, so new,
So strong, so true;
Before the earth received its frame,
He loved me—Blessed be His name!
2. He held the highest place above,
Adored by all the sons of flame,
Yet such His self-denying love,
He laid aside His crown and came
To seek the lost,
And at the cost
Of heavenly rank and earthly fame
He sought me—Blessed be His name!
3. It was a lonely path He trod,
From every human soul apart;
Known only to Himself and God
Was all the grief that filled His heart,
Yet from the track
He turned not back,
Till where I lay in want and shame,
He found me—Blessed be His name!
4. Then dawned at last that day of dread,
When desolate, yet undismayed,
With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,
He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,
Was then made sin
On Calvary,
And, dying there in grief and shame,
He saved me—Blessed be His name!
5. Long as I live my song shall tell
The wonders of His dying love;
And when at last I go to dwell
With Him His sovereign grace to prove,
My joy shall be
His face to see,
And bowing there with loud acclaim
I’ll praise Him—Blessed be His name!

Would of Thy love in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
Know more and more.

My Savior, Jesus; yet these lips of mine
Would fain proclaim to sinners, far and near,
A love which can remove all guilty fear,
And love beget.
3. It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,
My Savior, Jesus; yet this heart of mine
Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,
Which brings a rebel sinner, such as me,
Nigh unto God.
4. But though I cannot sing, or tell, or know
The fulness of Thy love, while here below,
My empty vessel I may freely bring;
O Thou, who art of love the living spring,

5. I am an empty vessel—not one thought
Or look of love to Thee I’ve ever brought;
Yet I may come, and come again to Thee,
With this the empty sinner’s only plea,
Thou lovest me.
6. Oh, fill me, Jesus, Savior, with Thy love!
Lead, lead me to the living fount above;
Thither may I, in simple faith draw nigh,
And never to another fountain fly,
But unto Thee.

But our Jesus died to have us
reconciled in him to God.
This was boundless love indeed;
Jesus is a Friend in need.
3. Men, when raised to lofty stations,
Often know their friends no more;
Slight and scorn their poor relations
Though they valued them before.
But our Savior always owns
Those whom He redeemed with groans.
4. When he lived on earth abased,
"Friend of sinners" was his name.
Now above all glory raised,
he rejoices in the same;
still he calls them brethren, friends,
and to all their wants attends.
5. Could we bear from one another

Yet this glorious Friend and Brother

though for good we render ill,

How shall we all to Heaven aspire?
As slaves redeemed from death and sin,
As brands plucked from eternal fire,
How shall we equal triumphs raise,
Or sing our great Deliverer’s praise?
2. Oh how shall we the goodness tell,
Father, which Thou to us hast showed?
Children of wrath, and doomed to hell,
But children now redeemed to God,
On earth we know our sins forgiven,
Blessed with this antepast of Heaven!
3. Our heart is full of Christ, and long
Their glorious matter to declare!
Of him we make our loftier song,
We cannot from his praise forbear;
Our ready tongue makes haste to sing
The glories of our heavenly King.

Perfect in comeliness thou art;
Replenished are thy lips with grace,
And full of love thy tender heart:
God ever blest! we bow the knee,
And own all fulness dwells in thee.

No change my heart shall fear;
And safe is such confiding,
For nothing changes here.
The storm may roar without me,
My heart may low be laid;
But God is round about me,
And can I be dismayed?

And I will walk with Him.

Bright skies will soon be o’er me,
Where darkest clouds have been.

A present help is He;

And love its Galilee.

Is by our beds of pain;
We touch Him in life’s throng and press,
And we are whole again.
7. Through Him the first fond prayers are said
Our lips of childhood frame,
The last low whispers of our dead
Are burdened with His name.
8. O Lord and master of us all,
Whate’er our name or sign,
We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,
We test our lives by Thine.

And every symbol wanes;
The Spirit over brooding all,
Eternal love remains.

In all its blackest hue,
Such is the mystery of grace,
It seals my pardon too.

My spirit now is filled;
That I should such a life destroy,
Yet live by Him I killed.

Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
Give Him glory, all ye people,

Open wide for all my sin,

A shelter in the time of storm;
Secure whatever ill betide,
A shelter in the time of storm.
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling shade on the burning sand,
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band-
A shelter in the time of storm.

A shelter in the time of storm;
No fears alarm, no fears affright,
A shelter in the time of storm.
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling shade on the burning sand,
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band-
A shelter in the time of storm.

A shelter in the time of storm;
We'll never leave our safe retreat,
A shelter in the time of storm.
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling shade on the burning sand,
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band-
A shelter in the time of storm.
4. O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Be Thou our helper ever near,
A shelter in the time of storm.
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling shade on the burning sand,
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band-
A shelter in the time of storm.

Of Thy loving heart.
Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee,
And Thy beauty fills my soul,
For, by Thy transforming power,
Thou hast made me whole.
2. Oh, how great Thy loving kindness,
Vaster, broader than the sea:
Oh, how marvelous Thy goodness,
Lavished all on me!
Yes, I rest in Thee, Beloved,
Know what wealth of grace is Thine,
Know Thy certainty of promise,
And have made it mine.
3. Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
I behold Thee as Thou art,
And Thy love, so pure, so changeless,
Satisfies my heart,
Satisfies its deepest longings,
Meets, supplies its every need,
Compasseth me round with blessings,
Thine is love indeed.
4. Ever lift Thy face upon me,
As I work and wait for Thee;
Resting ’neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus,
Earth’s dark shadows flee.
Brightness of my Father’s glory,
Sunshine of my Father’s face,
Keep me ever trusting, resting,
Fill me with Thy grace.

1. On Thee my heart is resting,
Ah, this is rest indeed:
What else, Almighty Savior,
Can a poor sinner need?
Thy light is all my wisdom,
Thy love is all my stay;
Thy coming back in glory,
Draws nearer every day.
2. My guilt is great, but greater
The mercy Thou dost give;

Hast died that I should live.
With Thee, my soul unfettered
Has risen from the dust;
Thy blood is all my treasure,
Thy word is all my trust.
3. Through me, Thou gentle Master,
Thy purposes fulfil;
I yield myself forever
To Thy most holy will.
What though I be but weakness?
My strength is not in me;
The poorest of Thy people
Has all things, having Thee.
4. When clouds are darkest round me,
Thou, Lord, art then most near,
My drooping faith to quicken,
My weary soul to cheer.
Safe nestling in Thy bosom,
I gaze upon Thy face;
In vain my foes would drive me
From Thee, my hiding-place.
5. ’Tis Thou hast made me happy,
’Tis Thou hast set me free;
To whom shall I give glory
Forever, but to Thee?
Of earthly love and blessing
Should every stream run dry,
Thy grace shall still be with me,
Thy grace, to live and die.

To thee are burdens, thorns and snares;
They cast dishonor on the Lord,
And contradict His gracious word.
2. Brought safely by His hand thus far,
Why wilt thou now give place to fear?
How canst thou want if He provide,
Or lose thy way with such a Guide?
3. When first before His mercy-seat
Thou didst to Him thine all commit;
He gave thee warrant from that hour
To trust His wisdom, love, and power.
4. Did ever trouble yet befall,
And He refuse to hear thy call?
And has He not His promise passed,
That thou shalt overcome at last?
5. He who has helped me hitherto
Will help me all my journey through,
And give me daily cause to raise
New Ebenezers to His praise.

It leads thee on, apace, to God;
Then count thy present trials small,
For God will make amends for all.

For there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.
1. When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way;
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.
2. Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh or a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.
3. Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief or a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.
4. But we never can prove
The delights of His love,
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.
5. Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do;
Where He sends, we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey.

God kindly veils my eyes,

And every joy He sends me comes
A sweet and glad surprise.
2. One step I see before me,
’Tis all I need to see,
The light of heaven more brightly shines
When earth’s illusions flee;
And sweetly through the silence comes,
His loving, “Trust in Me!”
3. Oh, blissful lack of wisdom,
’Tis blessed not to know;
He holds me with His own right hand,
And will not let me go,
And lulls my troubled soul to rest
In Him who loves me so.

Than go alone in the light;

My strength is made perfect in weakness,
My grace is sufficient for thee.
1. I’ll sing of the wonderful promise
That Jesus has given to me;
“My strength is made perfect in weakness,
My grace is sufficient for thee.”
And lest my poor heart should forget it,
Or ever forgetful should be,
He still keeps repeating the promise,
My grace is sufficient for thee.
2. His grace is sufficient to save me,
And cleanse me from guilt and from sin;
Sufficient to sanctify wholly,
And give me His Spirit within.
His grace is sufficient for trials,
No matter how hard they may be,
This promise stands over against them,
My grace is sufficient for thee.
3. His grace is sufficient for sickness,
Sustaining and making me whole;
His grace is sufficient when sorrows
Like billows roll over the soul.
His grace is sufficient for service,
It sets us from selfishness free,
And sends us to tell to the tried ones,
His grace is sufficient for thee.
4. His grace is sufficient to live by,
And should we be summoned to die
’Twill light up the valley of shadows,
And bear us away to Him nigh.
Or when we shall stand in His vict’ry,
And Christ in His glory shall see,
We’ll fall at His footstool confessing,
Thy grace was sufficient for me.
5. It is not our grace that’s sufficient,
But His grace, it ever must be:
Our graces are transient and changing;

3. His love, in time past,

Each sweet Ebenezer

4. Why should I complain
Of want or distress,
Temptation or pain?

The heirs of salvation,
I know from His Word,
Through much tribulation
Must follow their Lord.
5. How bitter that cup
No heart can conceive,
Which He drank quite up,
That sinners might live!
His way was much rougher
And darker than mine;
Did Christ, my Lord, suffer,
And shall I repine?

Far did I rove, and found no certain home;
At last I sought them in His sheltering breast,
Who opes His arms, and bids the weary come.
With Him I found a home, a rest divine;
And I since then am His, and He is mine.
2. Yes, He is mine! and naught of earthly things,
Not all the charms of pleasure, wealth or power,
The fame of heroes, or the pomp of kings,
Could tempt me to forgo His love an hour.
Go, worthless world, I Cry, with all that’s thine!
Go! I my Savior’s arm, and He is mine.
3. The good I have is from His stores supplied,
The ill is only what He deems the best.
He for my Friend, I’m rich with naught beside;
And poor without Him, though of all possessed.
Changes may come—I take, or I resign,
Content, while I am His, while He is mine.
4. Whate’er may change, in Him no change is seen,
A glorious Sun that wanes not nor declines;
Above the clouds and storms He walks serene,
And on His people’s inward darkness shines:
All may depart—I fret not, nor repine,
While I my Savior’s am, while He is mine.
5. He stays me falling; lifts me up hen down;
Reclaims me wandering; guars from every foe;
Plants on my worthless brow the victor’s crown,
Which in return before His feet I throw,
Grieved that I cannot better grace His shrine,
Who deigns to own me His, as He is mine.

But half discern Him, and but half adore;
But when I meet Him in the realms above,

And feel, and tell, amid the choir divine,
How fully I am His, and He is mine.

As the med’cine to the fainting,
As the wine-cup at the meal,
So, Lord, art Thou to me.

As the honey in the comb,
As the light within the lantern,
As the father in the home,
So, Lord, art Thou to me.

As the image in the glass,
As the fruit unto the fig tree,
As the dew unto the grass,

VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4
1. I’ve found a friend, O such a friend!
He loved me ere I knew Him;
He drew me with the cords of love,
And thus He bound me to Him;
And round my heart still closely twine
Those ties which naught can sever,
For I am His, and He is mine,
Forever and forever.
2. I’ve found a friend, O such a friend!
He bled, He died to save me;
And not alone the gift of life,
But His own self He gave me!
Naught that I have mine own I call,
I’ll hold it for the giver,
My heart, my strength, my life, my all
Are His, and His forever.
3. I’ve found a friend, O such a friend!
All power to Him is given,
To guard me on my onward course,
And bring me safe to Heaven.
The eternal glories gleam afar,
To nerve my faint endeavor;
So now to watch, to work, to war,
And then to rest forever.
4. I’ve found a friend, O such a friend!
So kind and true and tender,
So wise a counselor and guide,
So mighty a defender!
From Him who loves me now so well
What power my soul can sever?
Shall life or death, shall earth or hell?
No! I am His forever.

And purchased my salvation on Calv’ry’s tree.
1. Gone from my heart the world and all its charms;
Now through the blood I’m saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross my heart is bending low;
The precious blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow.
2. Once I was lost, and fallen deep in sin;
Once was a slave to passions fierce within;
Once was afraid to meet an angry God,
But now I’m cleansed from every stain thro’ Jesus’ blood.

Once I was blind, but now the light I see;
Once I was dead, but now in Christ I live,
To tell the world around the peace that He doth give.

Each day he grows still sweeter
Than he was the day before.
2. His glory broke upon me
When I saw him from afar.
He’s fairer than the lily
Brighter than the morning star.
He fills and satisfies my longing spirit o’re and o’re.
Each day he grows still sweeter
Than he was the day before.
3. My heart is sometimes heavy,
But he comes with sweet relief.
He folds me to his bosom
When I droop in blighting grief.
I love the Christ who all my
Burdens in his body bore.
Each day he grows still sweeter
Than he was the day before.

All my fresh springs are hid in Thee;

Close sheltered at Thy wounded side,
Each hour receiving “grace on grace,”
Until I see Thee face to face.

1. Jesus, my Lord, Thy nearness does impart
Sweet peace and gladness to the longing heart,
Thy gracious smile infuse a joyous thrill.
And soul and body with sweet pleasure fill.
And thankfulness.
2. We see not with our eyes Thy friendly face,
So full of kindness, love, and gentle grace
But in our hearts we know that Thou art here,
For Thou canst make us feel Thy presence near,
Although unseen.
3. Whoever makes it life's chief aim and end
To have his happiness on Thee depend.
In him a well of joy for ever springs,
And all day long his heart is glad, and sings
Who is like Thee?
4. To meet us ever with a friendly face,
In mercy, patience, and the kindest grace,
Daily Thy rich forgiveness to bestow.
To comfort, heal, in peace to bid us go,
Is Thy delight.
5. Lord, for Thy rich salvation, hear our prayer.
And daily give us an abounding share;
And let our souls, in all their poverty.
From deep-felt love be looking unto Thee
Till life's last end.
6. In sorrowing hours may our o'erflowing eyes
For comfort look to Thy dear sacrifice;
And, with Thy cross before us, may we find
Thy genuine image stamped upon our mind,
In constant view!
7. Lord, at all times mayst Thou within us find
A loving spirit and a childlike mind;
And from Thy wounds may we receive the power,
Through all life's weal and woe, in every hour,
To cling to Thee.
8. Thus, till the heavens receive us, shall we be
Like children, finding all our joys in Thee;
And though the tears of sorrow oft must fall,
Yet, if Thou to our hearts art All in All,
Sweet peace will come.
9. Thy wounded hand, dear Saviour, as a friend.
Thou dost to us in faithfulness extend;
At the sad sight our tears of grief must flow,
And conscious shame come o'er us as we go.
With thankful praise.

1. How tedious and tasteless the hours
When Jesus no longer I see!
Sweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flow’rs,
Have all lost their sweetness to me.
The midsummer sun shines but dim,
The fields strive in vain to look gay;
But when I am happy in Him
December’s as pleasant as May.
2. His name yields the richest perfume,
And sweeter than music His voice;
His presence disperses my gloom,
And makes all within me rejoice.
I should, were He always thus nigh,
Have nothing to wish or to fear;
No mortal so happy as I;
My summer would last all the year.
3. Content with beholding His face,
My all to His pleasure resigned;
No changes of season or place,
Would make any change in my mind.
While blessed with a sense of His love,
A palace a toy would appear;
And prisons would palaces prove,
If Jesus would dwell with me there.
4. My Lord, if indeed I am Thine,
If Thou art my sun and my song,
Say, why do I languish and pine?
And why are my winters so long?
Oh, drive these dark clouds from the sky,
Thy soul-cheering presence restore;
Or take me to Thee up on high,
Where winter and clouds are no more.

Within the holiest at home with God.
O holy place! O home divinely fair!
And we, God’s little ones, abiding there.
2. A long, long road I traveled night and day,
And sought to find within myself some way,
Aught I could do, or feel to bring me near;
Self effort failed, and I was filled with fear,
And then I found Christ was the only way
That I must come to Him and in Him stay.
3. O wondrous place! O home divinely fair!
And I, God’s little one, safe hidden there.

So make me dead to everything but Thee;
That as I rest within my home most fair,

Ever issued from His store;
To His own He gives full measure,
Running over, evermore,

2. There is always something over,

Take our portion with thanksgiving,
Praising for the things He planned.
Satisfaction, full and deepening,
All our need He doth supply,
When the heart has tasted Jesus
Its desires to satisfy,
When the heart has tasted Jesus

3. There is always something over,
When we share in all His love;
Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us,
Unscaled heights rise far above.
Human lips can never utter
All His wondrous tenderness.

And His Name forever bless,

That shadows fall on brightest hours,
That thorns remain;

Our weak heart clings,
Hast given us joys, tender and true,
Yet all with wings;
So that we see gleaming on high
Diviner things.

The best in store;
We have enough, yet not too much
To long for more:
A yearning for a deeper peace
Not known before.

Though amply blessed,
Can never find, although they seek
A perfect rest;
Nor ever shall, until they lean

Which lives when heaven and earth shall pass away

And tear the precious idol from our heart

Fastened to the Rock
Which cannot move
Grounded firm and deep

For 'tis well secured
By the Savior's hand
And the cables passed
From His heart to mine
Can defy the blast
Through strength divine

in the straits of fear
When the breakers
Have told the reef is near
Though the tempest rave
And the wild winds blow
Not an angry wave
Shall our bark o'erflow

in the floods of death
When the waters cold
Chill our latest breath
On the rising tide
It can never fail
While our hopes abide
Within the veil

Through the glaring night
The city of gold
Our harbor bright
We shall anchor fast
By the heavenly shore
With the storms all past
For evermore

Are besetting my track

I have heard people say
I'll fight till I die
And I'll ne'er run away
But when the temptations
So fiercely assailed
They left off believing
And terribly failed

Full of courage and zeal
Who go to the battle
Like warriors of steel
But right in the heat
Of the conflict with sin
Instead of believing
They faint and give in

And trust is not trace
And when all is seeming
As black as the night

Everlasting - Everlasting
Are the everlasting arms
1. Art thou sunk in depths of sorrow
Where no arm can reach so low
There is One whose arms almighty
Reach beyond thy deepest woe
God th'Eternal is thy refuge
Let it still - thy wild alarms
Underneath thy deepest sorrow
Are the everlasting arms
2. Other arms grow faint and weary
These can never faint nor fail
Others reach our mounts of blessing
These our lowest loneliest vale
O that all might know His friendship
O that all might see His charms
O that all might have beneath them
Jesus' everlasting arms
3. Underneath us O how easy
We have not to mount on high
But to sink into His fullness
And in trustful weakness lie
And we find our humbling failures
Save us from the strength that harms
We may fail but underneath us
Are the everlasting arms
4. Arms of Jesus fold me closer
To Thy strong and loving breast
Till my spirit on Thy bosom
Finds its everlasting rest
And when time's last sands are sinking
Shield my heart from all alarms
Softly whisp'ring
Underneath thee are the everlasting arms

But the treasure as of old
Fresh from glory gleaming brightly
Heaven's undimmed unchanging gold

Shining forth in ceaseless grace
Reaching weary hearts and lonely

Glorious calling saint is thine
Let the Lord but find thee emptied
Living branch in Christ the vine

Bearing wealth God's heart is prizing

And to God a vessel holier
Filled with Christ and Christ alone
Naught of earth to cloud the glory
Naught of self the light to dim
Telling forth His wondrous story
Emptied to be filled with Him

VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6
1. Marvel not that Christ in glory
All my inmost heart hath won
Not a star to cheer my darkness
But a light beyond the sun
2. All below lies dark and shadowed
Nothing there to claim my heart
Save the lonely track of sorrow
Where of old He walked apart
I was journeying in the noontide,
When His light shone o'er my road;
And I saw Him in that glory-
Saw Him-Jesus, Son of God.
All around, in noonday splendour
Earthly scenes lay fair and bright
But my eyes no longer see them
For the glory of that light
3. Others in the summer sunshine
Wearily may journey on
I have seen a light from heaven
Past the brightness of the sun
Light that knows no cloud no waning
Light wherein I see His face
All His love's uncounted treasures
All the riches of His grace
4. Sinners it was not to Angels
All this wondrous love was given
But to one who scorned despised Him
Scorned and hated Christ in heaven
From the lowest depths of evil
To the throne in heaven above
Thus in me He told the measure
Of His free, unbounded love
5. All the wonders of His glory
Deeper wonders of His love
How for me He won He keepeth
That high place in Heaven above
Not a glimpse - the veil uplifted
But within the veil to dwell
Gazing on His face forever
Hearing words unspeakable
6. I have seen the face of Jesus
Tell me not of aught beside
I have heard the voice of Jesus
All my soul is satisfied
In the radiance of the glory
First I saw His blessed face
And forever shall that glory
Be my home my dwelling place

And heaven's justice meet

That wondrous dream Was given
So seems my Savior's Cross to me
A ladder up to heaven

But on the farther side
The darkness of An awful grave
That gapes both Deep and wide
And there between us Stands the cross
Two arms outstretched To save
Like watchman set To guard the way
From that eternal grave
4. Upon that cross of Jesus
My eyes at times can see
The very dying Form of One
Who suffered there for me
And from my smitten Heart with tears
Two wonders I confess
The wonders of His Glorious love
And my own Worthlessness

For my abiding place
I ask no other sunshine
Than the sunshine Of His face
Content to let the World go by
To know no gain nor loss
My sinful self my Only shame

God in all His love made known!
Oh, the glories that surround there,
Those accepted in His Son!
Who can tell the depth of bliss
Spoken by the Father's kiss?

There I live, and yet not I;
Christ it is who there adores Thee:
Who more dear, or who more nigh?
All the Father's heart mine own --

So desolate and so forlorn
Lie buried down beneath the ground
Where not a sight and not a sound
Can even for one moment brief
Bring it a vestige of relief

Is shed upon its sorry plight
The darkness is so very dense
The lonliness is so intense
And there's no other to explain
Its strange estate to that lone grain
3. Concealed in such a somber spot
Can it consent to lie and rot
Can it submit to slow decay
Can it let life ebb all away
Can it lie still and simply wait
Till it shall quite disintegrate

A life that utterly defies
The grave and low beneath the soil
Can wrest from death the richest spoil
Do you behold those many grains
They're fruit of one seed's grievous pains

With darkness on its face

And flesh and heart give way
Then on Thy everlasting strength
With passive trust I stay
And the rough wind becomes a song
The darkness shines like day

Though silent anguish show
The love that in their hours of sleep
Unthanked may come and go
And blessed are the ears that hear
Though kept awake by woe

Though patient suffering teach
The secret of enduring strength
And praise too deep for speeh
Peace that no pressure from without
No strife within can reach

For Christ my Lord hath died
There is no curse in this my pain
For he was crucified
And it is fellowship with Him
That keeps me near His side

My heart is strong to bear
I will be joyful in Thy love
And peaceful in Thy care
Deal with me for my Savior's sake
According to His prayer

How blest soe'er it be
Yet may the chastened child be glad
His Father's face to see
And oh it is not hard to bear
What must be borne in Thee

In Thy own bosom laid
The trial of a soul redeemed
For Thy rejoicing made
Well may the heart in patience rest
That none can make afraid
13. Safe in Thy sanctifying grace
Almighty to restore
Borne onward sin and death behind
And love and life before
O let my soul abound in hope
And praise Thee more and more
14. Deep unto deep may call - but I
With peaceful heart will say
Thy loving-kindness hath a charge
No waves can take away
And let the storm that speeds me home
Deal with me as it may

My God alone
Outstretched and bruised

Is portioned out for me
The changes that will surely come
I do not fear to see
I ask Thee for a present mind
Intent on pleasing Thee
2. I ask Thee for a thoughtful love
Through constant watching wise
To meet the glad with joyful smiles
To wipe the weeping eyes
A heart at leisure from itself
To soothe and sympathize
3. I would not have the restless will
That hurries to and fro
Seeking for some great thing to do
Or secret thing to know
I would be treated as a child
And guided where I go
4. Wherever in the world I am
In what-soe'er estate
I have a fellowship with hearts
To keep and cultivate
A work of lowly love to do
For Him on whom I wait
5. I ask Thee for the daily strength
To none that ask denied
A mind to blend with outward life
While keeping at Thy side
Content to fill a little space
If Thou be glorified
6. On every path there is untruth
That I might patient be
In every way there is a cross
That I might lean on Thee
A lowly heart will find each place
A paradise for me
7. And if some things I ask not in
My cup of blessing be
I'd have my spirit filled the more
With grateful love to Thee
More careful-not to serve Thee much
But please Thee perfectly

There are no bonds for me
My inmost heart is taught the truth
That makes Thy children free
A life of self-renouncing love
Is one of liberty

I cannot sense my failure rife
But boasting in my earnest strife
Proudly I forward press

Thy searching light uncovers me
I see what I could never see

There's not a member but is lame
There's only deep regret and shame
O Lord how can I pray
7. Thy blood from judgement sets me free
Thy life from doom delivers me
How filthy yet I still must be
In shame my head I bow
8. In blindness I'm puffed up with pride
Thinking no need the facts to hide
My self-conceit has multiplied
While I in darkness boast
9. Whether I stay or move along
Whate'er I say I'm always wrong
So weak am I and never strong
Nothing I do is right

I fain would seek Thee as Thou art
Oh canst Thou e'er renew my heart
Have mercy Lord on me

Destitute despised forsaken
Thou from hence my all shalt be
Perish every fond ambition
All I've sought and hoped and known
Yet how rich is my condition
God and heaven are still my own

And while Thou shalt smile upon me

Foes may hate and friends may shun me
Show Thy face and all is bright

'Twill but drive me to Thy breast
Life with trials hard may press me

While Thy love is left to me
O 'twere not in joy to charm me
Were that joy unmixed with Thee
4. Go then earthly fame and treasure
Come disaster scorn and pain
In Thy service pain is pleasure
With Thy favor loss is gain
I have called Thee Abba Father
I have stayed my heart on Thee
Storms may howl and clouds may gather
All must work for good to me
5. Haste thee on from grace to glory
Armed by faith and winged by prayer
Heaven's eternal days before thee
God's own hand shall guide thee there
Soon shall close thy earthly mission
Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days
Hope shall change to glad fruition
Faith to sight and prayer to praise

Chase this self-will through all my heart
Through all its latent mazes there
Make me Thy duteous child that I

My heart which lowly waits Thy call
Speak to my inmost soul and say
"I am Thy Love - Thy God - Thy all"
To feel Thy power to hear Thy voice
To taste Thy love be all my choice

1. Via Bethlehem we journey
We whose hearts on God are set
Babe-like souls of Jesus learning
While our cheeks with tears are wet
For the manger and the stable
Are not pleasant to our eyes
But our feet must follow Jesus
If our hands would grasp the prize
2. Via Nazareth the pathway
Narrows still as on we go
Years of toil none understanding
Yet God teaches us to know
That the servant is not greater
Than the lord, who thro' long years
Hid Himself from this world's glory
Follow Him. Count not the tears
3. Via Galilee, we see Him
Stones are hurled and curses hissed
By the men who gather round Him
Has He not the pathway missed
No - unharmed the Savior passes
And this rough bit of the way
We must travel since like Jesus
Nothing can our purpose stay
4. Via too the awful anguish
Of the hours beneath the trees
Where the hosts of Satan linger
Awful hours of anguish these
Yet we fail not for God's angels
Minister to us and say
"Look, beloved at the glory
Conflict is but for a day!"
5. Then the Cross for via Calvary
Every royal soul must go
Here we draw the veil
For Jesus only can the pathway show
"If we suffer with Him" Listen
Just a little, little while
And the memory will have faded
In the glory of His smile
6. Then the grave with dear ones weeping
Knowing that all life has fled
(Fellow-pilgrims art thou numbered
With the men the world calls dead?)
Thence we rise and live with Jesus
Throned above the world's mad strife
Gladly forfeiting forever
All that worldlings count as life
7. On we press and yonder gleaming
Nearing every day we see
The great walls of that fair city
God has built for such as we
And we catch the tender music
Of the choirs that sing of One
Who once died to have us with Him
In His kingdom on the throne
8. Just a few more miles beloved
And our feet shall ache no more
No more sin, and no more sorrow
Hush thee Jesus went before
And I hear Him sweetly whispering
Faint not fear not still press on
For it may be ere tomorrow
The long Journey will be done

Shed from His judgment seat

For glory wealth and name
Let them procure their grandeur here
Their followers and fame

Though prospering not in soul
Yet faithfully I'll follow Him
Until I reach the goal
8. I know that when on earth He dwelt
His lot was but the cross
And that is why I only wish
With Him to suffer loss

The Lord will dry my tears
So faithfully I'll still press on

Midst enviroment so stern
How unlike the untamed flowers
Growing in the wilderness
In a maze of wild confusion
Making patterns numberless
2. But the blossoms of the grapevine
Without glory are and small
Though they do have some expression
They are hardly seen withal
But a day since they have flowered
Into fruit the blooms have grown
Never may they wave corollas
With luxuriant beauty shown
3. To a post the vine is fastened
Thus it cannot freely grow
When its branches are extended
To the trellis tied they go
To the stony soil committed
Drawing thence its food supply
It can never choose its own way
Or from difficulty fly
4. Oh how beautiful its verdure
Which in spring spreads o'er the field
From life's energy and fullness
Growth abundant doth it yield
Till it's full of tender branches
Twining freely everywhere
Stretching 'gainst the sky's deep azure
Tasting sweetly of the air
5. But the master of the vineyard
Not in lenience doth abide
But with knife and pruning scissors
Then would strip it of its pride
Caring not the vine is tender
But with deep precision stroke
All the pretty excess branches
From the vine are neatly broke
6. In this time of loss and ruin
Does the vine self-pity show
Nay it gives itself more fully
To the hand that strips its branches
Till of beauty destitute
That its life may not be wasted
But preserved for bearing fruit
7. Into hard wood slowly hardens
Every stump of bleeding shoot
Each remaining branch becoming
Clusters of abundant fruit
Then beneath the scorching sunshine
Leaves are dried and from it drop
Thus the fruit more richly ripens
Till the harvest of the crop
8. Bowed beneath its fruitful burden
Loaded branches are brought low
Labor of its growth through suff'ring
Many a purposed cutting blow
Now its fruit is fully ripened
Comforted the vine would be
But the harvest soon is coming
And its days of comfort flee
9. Hands will pick and feet will trample
All the riches of the vine
Till from out the reddeded wine-press
Flows a river full of wine
All the day its flow continues
Bloody-red without alloy
Gushing freely richly sweetly
Filling all the earth with joy
10. In appearance now the grapevine
Barren is and pitiful
Having given all it enters
Into night inscrutable
No one offers to repay it
For the cheering wine that's drunk
But 'tis stripped and cut e'en further
To a bare and branchless trunk
11. Yet its wine throughout the winter
Warmth and sweetness ever bears
Unto those in coldness shiv'ring
Pressed with sorrow pain and cares
Yet without alone the grapevine
Midst the ice and snow doth stand
Steadfastly it lot enduring
Though 'tis hard to understand
12. Winter o'er the vine prepareth
Fruit again itself to bear
Budding forth and growing branches
Beauteous green again to wear
Never murmuring or complaining
For the winter's sore abuse
Or for all its loss desiring
Its fresh off'ring to reduce
13. Breathing air untainted heavenly
As it lifts its arms on high
Earth's impure defiled affections
Ne'er the vine may occupy
Facing sacrifice yet smiling
And while love doth prune once more
Strokes it bears as if it never
Suffered loss and pain before
14. From the branches of the grapevine
Sap and blood and wine doth flow
Does the vine for all it suffered
Lost and yielded poorer grow
Drunkards of the earth and wanderers
From it drink and merry make
From their pleasure and enjoyment
Do they richer thereby wake
15. Not by gain our life is measured
But by what we've lost 'tis scored
'Tis not how much wine is drunken
But how much has been outpoured
For the strength of love e'er standeth
In the sacrifice we bear
He who has the greatest suff'ring
Ever has the most to share
16. He who treats himself severely
Is the best for God to gain
He who hurts himself most dearly
Most can comfort those in pain
He who suffering never beareth
Is but empty "sounding brass"
He who self-life never spareth
Has the joys which all surpass

VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6
1. Long plunged in sorrow I resign
My soul to that dear hand of Thine
Without reserve or fear
That hand shall wipe my streaming eyes
Or into smiles of glad surprise
Transform the falling tear
2. My sole possession is Thy love
In earth beneath or heaven above
I have no other store
And though with fervent suit I pray
And importune thee night and day
I ask Thee nothing more
3. The Cross - O ravishment and bliss
How grateful e'en its anguish is
Its bitterness how sweet
There every sense and all the mind
In all her faculties refined
Taste happiness complete
4. Self-love no grace in sorrow sees
Consults her own peculiar ease
'Tis all the bliss she knows
But nobler aims true love employ
In self-denial is her joy
In suffering her repose
5. Sorrow and love go side by side
Nor height nor depth can e'er divide
Their heaven-appointed bands
Those dear associates still are one
Nor till the race of life is run
Disjoin their wedded hands
6. Thy choice and mine shall be the same
Inspirer of that holy flame
Which must forever blaze
To take the cross and follow Thee
Where love and duty lead shall be
My portion and my praise

Fearing what the storm may bring
Never find on Jesus' breast

But when storms have done their worst
Then the soul surviving all
In Eternal arms is nursed
There to find that nought can move
One embosomed in such love

E'en a craft to sail the sea
Still a voyager yet now
Anchored to Infinity
Nothing left to do but fling

Yet soon they will rise and His visage behold
The sight of His glory will gain
But Mary beholding His tear dimmed eyes
Could see His heart's anguish and pain

2. We soon will see Jesus our Lord face to face
We'll know him as never before
But then there's no need for a hand such as His
To heal a heart broken and sore
In heaven we'll offer Him praise without end
No praying or tears needed there
Nor ever a burden to roll on our Friend
Or place for importunate prayer
Or place for importunate prayer
3. In heavenly glory that day we'll be crowned
And nevermore carry a cross
'Tis only on earth where our Lord was disowned
We share His rejection and loss
When entering rest in that morning so fair
Our anguish and trials will end
His sorrow and shame we'll no more with Him share
Or sacrifice pleasures for Him
Or sacrifice pleasures for Him
4. Alas we are left with few chances to share
To learn and to taste of His grief
Yet still for His sake His reproach we may bear
Such times we can never retrieve
Reviling and scorn shall we still here bemoan
When soon they no longer will be
I treasure these temporal blessings I've known
For thus Lord I'm made one with Thee
For thus Lord I'm made one with Thee
5. I long Lord to gaze on Thy wonderful face
'Tis better by far Thee to meet
But now I would choose Thy dear suffering grace
And not miss such fellowship sweet
Have mercy on me - fill me Lord with Thy love

Lest earnestly seeking a heaven above

Shepherd of His sheep

There each hungry soul
May take whate'er he needs
Lovingly He draws each soul
That truly lives
And in bread and wine
Himself to them He gives

Through abounding grace
Hear the song of triumph
From the ransomed race
All in glory shinning
Glory not their own
Gathered into oneness

Should set His love upon the sons of men
Or why as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers
To bring them back they know not how or when
But this I know that He was born of Mary
When Bethlehem's manger was His only home
And that He lived at Nazareth and laboured
And so the Saviour Saviour of the world is come
2. I cannot tell how silently He suffered
As with His peace He graced this place of tears
Or how His heart upon the cross was broken
The crown of pain to three and thirty years
But this I know He heals the broken-hearted
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear
And lifts the burden from the heavy-laden
For yet the Saviour Saviour of the world is here
3. I cannot tell how He will win the nations
How He will claim His earthly heritage
How satisfy the needs and aspirations
Of east and west of sinner and of sage
But this I know all flesh shall see His glory
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown
And some glad day His sun shall shine in splendour
When He the Saviour Saviour of the world is known
4. I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship
When at His bidding every storm is stilled
Or who can say how great the jubilation
When all the hearts of men with love are filled

And earth to heaven and heaven to earth will answer

For I forget so soon
The early dew of morning

With earnest tones and grave
Remember I'm the sinner
Whom Jesus came to save
Tell me the story always
If you would really be
In any time of trouble

When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory
Is costing me too dear
Yes and when that world's glory
Is dawning on my soul
Tell me the old old story-

2. Room for pleasure room for business
But for Christ the crucified
Not a place that He can enter
In the heart for which He died
3. Have you any room for Jesus
As in grace He calls again
O today is time accepted
Tomorrow you may call in vain
4. Room and time now give to Jesus
Soon will pass God's day of grace
Soon thy heart left cold and silent
And thy Savior's pleading cease

In the shade of the forest tree

That should set Thy people free
But with mocking scorn
And with crown of thorn
They bore Thee to Calvary

And her choirs shall sing

Until the courts of heaven rang

It made my aching heart rejoice

A mocking crown so thorny
Was placed upon His head
I wondered what He saw in me
To suffer such deep agony

While with adoring wonder
His blessing I retrace
It seems as if eternal days

In the shelter of the fold
But one was out on the hills away
Far off from the gates of gold
Away on the mountains wild and bare
Away from the tender Shepherd's care
Away from the tender Shepherd's care
2. Lord Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine
Are they not enough for Thee
But the Shepherd made answer
This of Mine has wandered away from Me
And although the road be rough and steep
I go to the desert to find My sheep
I go to the desert to find My sheep
3. But none of the ransomed ever knew
How deep were the waters crossed
Nor how dark was the night
That the Lord passed through
Ere He found His sheep that was lost
Out in the desert He heard its cry
Sick and helpless and ready to die
Sick and helpless and ready to die
4. Lord whence are those blood-drops all the way
That mark out the mountain's track
They were shed for one who had gone astray
Ere the Shepherd could bring him back
Lord whence are Thy hands so rent and torn
They're pierced tonight by many a thorn
They're pierced tonight by many a thorn
5. But all thro' the mountains thunder riven
And up from the rocky steep
There arose a glad cry to the gate of heaven
Rejoice I have found My sheep
And the angels echoed around the throne
Rejoice for the Lord brings back His own
Rejoice for the Lord brings back His own

1. If I gained the world but lost the savior
Were my life worth living for a day
Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort
In the things that soon must pass away
If I gained the world but lost the Savior
Would my gain be worth the life-long strife
Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing
For a moment with a Christ-filled life
2. Had I wealth and love in fullest measure
And a name revered both far and near
Yet no hope beyond no harbor waiting
Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer
If I gained the world but lost the Savior
Who endured the cross and died for me
Could then all the world afford a refuge
Whither in my anguish I might flee
3. O what emptiness without the Savior
'Mid the sins and sorrows here below
And eternity how dark without Him
Only night and tears and endless woe
What though I might live without the Savior
When I come to die how would it be
O to face the valley's gloom without Him
And without Him all eternity
4. O the joy of having all in Jesus
What a balm the broken heart to heal
Ne'er a sin so great but He'll forgive it
Nor a sorrow that He does not feel
If I have but Jesus only Jesus
Nothing else in all the world beside
O then ev'rything is mine in Jesus
For my needs and more He will provide

4. So when my latest breath
Shall rend the veil in twain,
By death I shall escape from death,
And life eternal gain.
That resurrection-word,
That shout of victory;
Once more,"Forever with the Lord!"
Amen, so let it be!
