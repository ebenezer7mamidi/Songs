SongTitle: O Bread to pilgrims given
VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3
1. O Bread to pilgrims given,
  O Food for saints to eat,
O Manna sent from heaven,
  For heav’n-born natures meet;
Give us, for Thee long pining,
  To eat till richly filled;
Till, earth’s delights resigning,
  Our every wish is stilled.
2. O Water, life bestowing,
  From out the Savior’s heart,
A fountain purely flowing,
  A fount of love Thou art.
Oh, let us, freely tasting,
  Our burning thirst assuage;
Thy sweetness, never wasting,
  Avails from age to age.
3. Jesus, this feast receiving,
  We Thee unseen adore;
Thy faithful word believing,
  We take, and doubt no more.
Give us, Thou true and loving,
  On earth to live in Thee;
Then, God the veil removing,
  Thy glorious face to see.

Chorus1 : Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
All along my pilgrim journey,
  Savior, let me walk with Thee.
Chorus2 : Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
  Only let me walk with Thee.
Chorus3 : Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Then the gate of life eternal
  May I enter, Lord, with Thee.
1. Thou my everlasting Portion,
More than friend or life to me,
All along my pilgrim journey,
Savior, let me walk with Thee
2. Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Not for fame my prayer shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.
3. Lead me through the vale of shadows,
Bear me o’er life’s fitful sea;
Then the gate of life eternal
May I enter, Lord, with Thee.

SongTitle: I am Thine, O Lord
VerseOrder: v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1 v4 c1
Chorus1 : Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
  To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
    To Thy precious, bleeding side.
1. I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,
  And it told Thy love to me;
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
  And be closer drawn to Thee.
2. Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,
  By the pow’r of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
  And my will be lost in Thine.
3. O the pure delight of a single hour
  That before Thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,
  I commune as friend with friend!
4. There are depths of love that I yet may know
  Till Thee face to face I see;
There are heights of joy that I yet may reach
  Till I rest in peace with Thee.
