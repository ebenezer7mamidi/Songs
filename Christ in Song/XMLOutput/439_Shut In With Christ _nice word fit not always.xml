Shut in from the
ceaseless din
of the restless world
and its want and sin
Shut in from its turmoil
Care and strife
And all the wearisome round of life{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Shut in with tears
That are spent in vain
With dull compaionship
Of pain
Shut in with the changeless
Days and hours
And the bitter knowledge
Of failing powers{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Shut in with a trio
of angels sweet
Patience and Grace
All pain to meet
With faith that can suffer
And stand and wait
And lean on the promises
Strong and great{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Shut in with Christ
Oh wonderful the thought
Shut in with peace
His sufferings brought
Shut in with the love
That wields the rod
Oh company blest
Shut in with God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
