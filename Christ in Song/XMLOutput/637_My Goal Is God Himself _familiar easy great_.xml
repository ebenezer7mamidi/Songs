Nor even blessing but Himself my God
Tis His to lead me there - nor mine - but His
At any cost dear Lord by any road{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}So faith bounds forward to its goal in God
And love can trust her Lord to lead her there
Upheld by Him my soul is following hard
Till God hath full fulfilled my deepest prayer{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}No matter if the way be sometimes dark
No matter if the cost be oft-times great
He knoweth how I best shall reach the mark
The way that leads to Him must needs be straight{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}One thing I know I cannot say Him nay
One thing I do I press towards my Lord
My God my glory here, from day to day
And in the glory there my great reward{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
