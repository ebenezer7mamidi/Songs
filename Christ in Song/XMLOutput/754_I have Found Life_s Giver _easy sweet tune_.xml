He has quenched my thirst
And vanquished all my strife
He my living bread became my daily meat
Death has died in Him
Life's triumph is complete{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}In the Church what glory
Far horizons glow
And His Name all radiant
On each brow doth show
Christ doth breathe upon her
As He did of old
Shepherd of His sheep
All gathered in one fold{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There one holy flame doth burn
Within each breast
By one blood redeemed in Christ
They find their rest
All their thirst He quenches
From one living stream
They in adoration
Lowly worship Him{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}There as Bread of life
Faint souls He ever feeds
There each hungry soul
May take whate'er he needs
Lovingly He draws each soul
That truly lives
And in bread and wine
Himself to them He gives{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Gone is all the earth-taint
Through abounding grace
Hear the song of triumph
From the ransomed race
All in glory shinning
Glory not their own
Gathered into oneness
They approach the throne{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
