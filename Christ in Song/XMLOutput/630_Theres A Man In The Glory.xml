whose Life is for me
He's pure and He's holy,
triumphant and free
He's wise and He's loving,
how tender is He!
His Life in the glory,
my life must be
His Life in the glory,
my life must be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}There's a Man in the glory
whose Life is for me
He overcame Satan,
from bondage He's free
In Life he is reigning,
how kingly is He!
His life in the glory,
my life must be
His life in the glory,
my life must be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There's a Man in the glory
whose Life is for me
In Him is no sickness,
no weakness has He
He's strong and in vigor,
how buoyant is He!

my life may be
His life in the glory,
my life may be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}There's a Man in the glory
whose Life is for me
His peace is abiding,
how patient is He!
He's joyful and radiant
expecting to see
His life in the glory,
lived out in me
His life in the glory,
lived out in me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
