Beautiful, beautiful, Zion:
We’re marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Come, ye that love the Lord,
And let your joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne,
And thus surround the throne.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God:
But children of the heav’nly King,
But children of the heav’nly King
Shall speak their joys abroad,
Shall speak their joys abroad.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets;
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
Or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Then let our songs abound,
And ev’ry tear be dry;
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,
We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground
To fairer worlds on high,
To fairer worlds on high.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
