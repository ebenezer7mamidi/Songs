How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, my all in all!
The great Creator became my Savior,
And all God’s fulness dwelleth in Him.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Down from His glory,
Ever living story,
My God and Savior came,
And Jesus was His name.
Born in a manger,
To His own a stranger,
A Man of sorrows, tears and agony.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}What condescension,
Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night,
Not one faint hope in sight,
God, gracious, tender,
Laid aside His splendor,
Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Without reluctance,
Flesh and blood His substance
He took the form of man,
Revealed the hidden plan.
O glorious myst’ry,
Sacrifice of Calv’ry,
And now I know Thou art the great “I AM.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
