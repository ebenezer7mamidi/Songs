He loved me ere I knew Him;
He drew me with the cords of love,
And thus He bound me to Him;
And round my heart still closely twine
Those ties which naught can sever,
For I am His, and He is mine,
Forever and forever.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I’ve found a friend, O such a friend!
He bled, He died to save me;
And not alone the gift of life,
But His own self He gave me!
Naught that I have mine own I call,
I’ll hold it for the giver,
My heart, my strength, my life, my all
Are His, and His forever.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I’ve found a friend, O such a friend!
All power to Him is given,
To guard me on my onward course,
And bring me safe to Heaven.
The eternal glories gleam afar,
To nerve my faint endeavor;
So now to watch, to work, to war,
And then to rest forever.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I’ve found a friend, O such a friend!
So kind and true and tender,
So wise a counselor and guide,
So mighty a defender!
From Him who loves me now so well
What power my soul can sever?
Shall life or death, shall earth or hell?
No! I am His forever.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
