When the stormclouds break
And the loud thunder
Bids the soul awake
When biting blasts
lay earthly projects low
And one by one
The fondest treasures go{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus triumphant
Through the fleeting years
Jesus triumphant
Spite of blinding tears
High over all
To hear Thy loving voice
Which bids the heart
Look upward and rejoice{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus triumphant
When in work for Thee
Sad and disheartened
No results we see
When gathered force
Of evil seems to win
And work for Christ
Seems lost in work of sin{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus triumphant
All along the line
Triumphant Savior
All Thy triumph mine
For since I am
A partner in Thy love
My life on earth is
Lived through Thee above{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus triumphant
When the spirit wings
Upward and heav'nward
To the King of kings
And through the last
Great triumph of Thy grace
Triumphant saints shall see
Thee face to face{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
