Bring the long looked for day;
O why these years of waiting here,
These ages of decay?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Come, for Thy saints still wait;
Daily ascends their sigh;
The Spirit and the Bride say, Come;
Does Thou not hear the cry?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Come, for creation groans,
Impatient of Thy stay,
Worn out with these long years of ill,
These ages of delay.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Come, for the good are few;
They lift the voice in vain;
Faith waxes fainter on the earth,
And love is on the wane.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Come, for the truth is weak,
And error pours abroad
Its subtle poison o’er the earth—
An earth that hates her God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Come, for love waxes cold,
Its steps are faint and slow;
Faith now is lost in unbelief,
Hope’s lamp burns dim and low.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Come, for the corn is ripe,
Put in thy sickle now,
Reap the great harvest of the earth—
Sower and reaper Thou.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Come, and make all things new,
Build up this ruined earth;
Restore our faded paradise,
Creation’s second birth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v9"><lines>{lang-eng}Come, and begin Thy reign
Of everlasting peace;
Come, take the kingdom to Thyself,
Great King of righteousness.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
