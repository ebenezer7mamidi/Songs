So great! so full! so free!
Fain would we have our thoughts, our hearts,
Our lives, engaged with Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We love Thee for the glorious worth
Which in Thyself we see;
We love Thee for that shameful cross,
Endured so patiently.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}No man of greater love can boast
Than for his friend to die;
Thou for Thine enemies wast slain!
What love with Thine can vie?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Though in the very form of God,
With heav’nly glory crowned,
Thou didst a servant’s form assume,
Beset with sorrow round.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou wouldst like wretched man be made
In everything but sin,
That we as like Thee might become
As we unlike had been:{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Like Thee in strength, in meekness, love,
In life in ev’ry phase;
From glory into glory changed,
Till we behold Thy face.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}O Lord, we treasure in our hearts
The mem’ry of Thy love;
And ever shall Thy name to us
A grateful odor prove.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
