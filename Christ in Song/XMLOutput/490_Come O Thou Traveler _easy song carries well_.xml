Whom still I hold but cannot see
My company before is gone
And I am left alone with Thee
With Thee all night I mean to stay
And wrestle till the break of day{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I need not tell Thee who I am
My misery and sin declare
Thyself hast called me by my name
Look on Thy hands and read it there
But who I ask Thee who art Thou
Tell me Thy name and tell me now{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In vain Thou strugglest to get free
I never will unloose my hold
Art Thou the Man that died for me
The secret of Thy love unfold
Wrestling I will not let Thee go
Till I Thy name - Thy nature know{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Wilt Thou not to me reveal
Thy new unutterable Name
Tell me I still beseech Thee tell
To know it now resolved I am
Wrestling I will not let Thee go
Till I Thy Name - Thy nature know{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}'Tis all in vain to hold Thy tongue
Or touch the hollow of my thigh
Though every sinew be unstrung
Out of my arms Thou shalt not fly
Wrestling I will not let Thee go
Till I Thy name - Thy nature know{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}What though my shrinking flesh complain
And murmur to contend so long
I rise superior to my pain
When I am weak then I am strong
And when all of my strength shall fail
I shall with the God-man prevail{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}My strenth is gone my nature dies
I sink beneath Thy weighty hand
Faint to revive and fall to rise
I fall and yet by faith I stand
I stand and will not let Thee go
Till I Thy Name - Thy nature know{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Yield to me now for I am weak
But confident in self despair
Speak to my heart in blessing speak
Be conquered by my instant prayer
Speak or thou never hence shalt move
And tell me if Thy name be Love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v9"><lines>{lang-eng}'Tis Love - 'tis Love
Thou diedst for me
I hear Thy whisper in my heart
The morning breaks the shadows flee
Pure Universal Love Thou art
To me let all Thy mercies move
Thy nature and Thy name is Love
10. My prayer hath power with God the grace
Unspeakable I now recieve
Through faith I see Thee face to face
I see Thee face to face and live
In vain I have not wept and strove
Thy nature and Thy Name is Love
11. I know Thee Savior who Thou art
Jesus the feeble sinner's friend
Nor wilt Thou with the night depart
But stay and love me to the end
Thy mercies never shall remove
Thy nature and Thy Name is Love
12. The Sun of righteousness on me
Hath ris'n with healing in His wings
Withered my nature's strength from Thee
My soul its life and succor brings
My help is all laid up above
Thy nature and Thy Name is Love
13. Contented now upon my thigh
I halt till life's short journey end
All helplessness all weakness I
On Thee alone for strength depend
Nor have I power from Thee to move
Thy nature and Thy name is Love
14. Lame as I am I take the prey
Hell earth and sin with ease o'ercome
I leap for joy - pursue my way
And as a bounding hart I run
Through all eternity to prove
Thy nature and Thy name is Love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
