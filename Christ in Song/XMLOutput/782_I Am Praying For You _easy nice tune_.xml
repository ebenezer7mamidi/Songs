For you I am praying
For you I am praying
I'm praying for you{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I have a Saviour
He's pleading in glory
A dear loving Saviour
Though earth friends be few
And now He is watching
In tenderness o'er me
But oh that my Saviour
Were your Saviour too{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I have a Father
To me He has given
A hope for eternity
Blessed and true
And soon will He call me
To meet Him in heaven
But oh that He'd let me
Bring you with me too{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I have a peace
It is calm as a river
A peace that the friends
Of this world never knew
My Saviour alone is
It's Author and Giver
And oh could I know
It was given to you{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}When Jesus has found you
Tell others the story
That my loving Savior
Is your Savior too
Then pray that your Savior
May bring them to glory
And prayer will be answered
'twas answered for you{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
