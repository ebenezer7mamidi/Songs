The temple courts were dark
The lamp was burning dim
Before the sacred ark
When suddenly a voice divine
Rang through the silence of the shrine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The old man meek and mild
The priest of Israel slept
His watch the temple child
The little Levite kept
And what from Eli's sense was sealed
The Lord to Hannah's son revealed{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O give me Samuel's ear
The open ear O Lord
Alive and quick to hear
Each whisper of Thy word
Like him to answer at Thy call
And to obey Thee first of all{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O give me Samuel's heart
A lowly heart that waits
Where in Thy house Thou art
Or watches at Thy gates
By day and night a heart that still
Moves at the breathing of Thy will{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}O give me Samuel's mind
A sweet unmurmuring faith
Obedient and resigned
To Thee in life and death
That I may read with child-like eyes
Truths that are hidden from the wise{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
