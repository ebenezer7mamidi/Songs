'Tis ours to obey; 'tis His to provide:
Though cisterns be broken, and creatures all fail,
The word He hath spoken shall surely prevail.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}His love in times past forbids us to think
He'll leave us at last in trouble to sink:
The Lamb in His glory is ever in view,
The pledge and the proof He will help us quite through.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}And since all we meet must work for our good,
The bitter is sweet, the medicine is food:
Though painful at present, 'twill cease before long,
And then how triumphant the conqueror's song!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
