Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said,
To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}“Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,
For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
I’ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}“When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}“When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;

Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}“E’en down to old age all My people shall prove
My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;
And then, when grey hairs shall their temples adorn,
Like lambs they shall still in My bosom be borne.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}“The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
I’ll never, no, never, no, never forsake!”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
