O gentle breeze of love;
More fragrant than the myrtle tree
The Henna-flower is to me,
The Balm of Heaven above.
The Balm of Heaven above.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I cannot gaze enough on Thee,
Thou Fairest of the Fair;
My heart is filled with ecstasy,
As in Thy face of radiancy
I see such beauty there.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I cannot work enough to Thee,
My Savior, Master, Friend;
I do not wish to go out free,
But ever, always, willingly,
To serve Thee to the end.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I cannot sing enough of Thee,
The sweetest name on earth;
A note so full of melody
Comes from my heart so joyously,
And fills my soul with mirth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I cannot speak enough of Thee,
I have so much to tell;
Thy heart it beats so tenderly
As Thou dost draw me close to Thee,
And whisper, “All is well.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
