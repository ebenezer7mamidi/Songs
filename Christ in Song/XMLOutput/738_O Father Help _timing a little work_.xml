Lest our poor love refuse
For Thy redeemed
The life that they would choose
And in our fear of loss
For them or pain
Forget eternal gain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Teach us to pray
Remembering Calvary
For as the Master
Must the servant be
We see their face
Set toward Jerusalem
Let us not hinder them{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Show us the gain
The golden harvest there
For corn of wheat
That they have buried here
Lest human love
Defraud them and betray
Teach us O God to pray{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Teach us to pray
O Thou who didst not spare
Thy Well-Beloved
Lead us on in prayer
Purge from the earthly
Give us love divine
Father like Thine - like Thine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
