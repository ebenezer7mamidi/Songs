Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suff’ring and shame,
And I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see;
For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
Its shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me someday to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
