Forever flowing free,
Forever shared, forever whole,
A never ebbing sea!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Our outward lips confess the name
All other names above;
Love only knoweth whence it came,
And comprehendeth love.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Blow, winds of God, awake and blow
The mists of earth away:
Shine out, O light divine, and show
How wide and far we stray.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}We may not climb the heavenly steeps
To bring the Lord Christ down;
In vain we search the lowest deeps,
For Him no depths can drown.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}But warm, sweet, tender, even yet,
A present help is He;
And faith still has its Olivet,
And love its Galilee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}The healing of His seamless dress
Is by our beds of pain;
We touch Him in life’s throng and press,
And we are whole again.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Through Him the first fond prayers are said
Our lips of childhood frame,
The last low whispers of our dead
Are burdened with His name.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}O Lord and master of us all,
Whate’er our name or sign,
We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,
We test our lives by Thine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v9"><lines>{lang-eng}The letter fails, the systems fall,
And every symbol wanes;
The Spirit over brooding all,
Eternal love remains.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
