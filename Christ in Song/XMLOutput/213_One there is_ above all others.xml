well deserves the name of Friend;
his is love beyond a brother's,
costly, free, and knows no end.
They who once his kindness prove
find it everlasting love.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Which of all our friends, to save us,
could or would have shed his blood?
But our Jesus died to have us
reconciled in him to God.
This was boundless love indeed;
Jesus is a Friend in need.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Men, when raised to lofty stations,
Often know their friends no more;
Slight and scorn their poor relations
Though they valued them before.
But our Savior always owns
Those whom He redeemed with groans.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}When he lived on earth abased,
"Friend of sinners" was his name.
Now above all glory raised,
he rejoices in the same;
still he calls them brethren, friends,
and to all their wants attends.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Could we bear from one another
what he daily bears from us?
Yet this glorious Friend and Brother
loves us, though we treat him thus:
though for good we render ill,
he accounts us brethren still.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}O for grace our hearts to soften!
Teach us, Lord, at length to love;
we, alas! forget too often
what a Friend we have above:
but when home our souls are brought,
we will love you as we ought.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
