No hidden scar
On foot or side or hand?
I hear thee sung
Throughout the land
I hear them hail thy shining star
Hast thou no scar?
No scar?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Hast thou no wound?
Yet I was wounded
By the archers spent
Leaned Me against
A tree and rent
By ravening beasts
'Round me I swooned
Hast thou no wound?
No wound?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}No wound? No scar?
Yet as the Master
Shall the servant be
And pierced the feet
That follow Me
But whole?
Can he have followed far
Who has no wound
No scar?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
