Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone;
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away;
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while life shall last,
And our eternal home.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
