It is to dwell in peace
How pleasing to our King
This fruit of righteousness
When brethren all in one agree
They know the joy of unity
They know the joy of unity{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When all are sweetly joined
True followers of the Lamb
They're one in heart and mind
They think and speak the same
When all in love together dwell
The comfort is unspeakable
The comfort is unspeakable{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Where unity takes place
The joys of heaven we prove
This is the gospel grace
The unction from above
The Spirit on all saints is shed
Descending swift from Christ our head
Descending swift from Christ our head{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Where unity is found
The sweet anointing grace
Extends to all around
And consecrates the place
To every waiting soul it comes
And fills it with divine perfumes
And fills it with divine perfumes{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}From Aaron's beard it rolls
Those nearest to His face
The humble trembling souls
Who know abundant grace
The grace the grace for all is free
For lo it reaches now to me
For lo it reaches now to me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}On all His chosen ones
The precious oil comes down
Anointing as it runs
Anointing on and on
E'en to His skirts - the meanest name
That longs to love the bleeding Lamb
That longs to love the bleeding Lamb{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Grace every morning new
And every night we feel
The soft refreshing dew
That falls on Hermon's hill
On Zion it doth sweetly fall
The grace of one descends on all
The grace of one descends on all{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
