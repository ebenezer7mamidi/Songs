My Savior is near,
And for my relief
Will surely appear;
By prayer let me wrestle,
And He will perform;
With Christ in the vessel,
I smile at the storm.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Though dark be my way,
Since He is my Guide,
’Tis mine to obey,
’Tis His to provide;
Though cisterns be broken,
And creatures all fail,
The word He hath spoken
Shall surely prevail.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}His love, in time past,
Forbids me to think
He’ll leave me at last
In trouble to sink:
Each sweet Ebenezer
I have in review
Confirms His good pleasure
To help me quite through.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Why should I complain
Of want or distress,
Temptation or pain?
He told me no less;
The heirs of salvation,
I know from His Word,
Through much tribulation
Must follow their Lord.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}How bitter that cup
No heart can conceive,
Which He drank quite up,
That sinners might live!
His way was much rougher
And darker than mine;
Did Christ, my Lord, suffer,
And shall I repine?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Since all that I meet
Shall work for my good,
The bitter is sweet,
The medicine, food;
Though painful at present,
’Twill cease before long,
And then, oh, how pleasant
The conqueror’s song!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
