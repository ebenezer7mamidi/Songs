A shelter in the time of storm;
Secure whatever ill betide,
A shelter in the time of storm.
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling shade on the burning sand,
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band-
A shelter in the time of storm.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}A shade by day, defense by night,
A shelter in the time of storm;
No fears alarm, no fears affright,
A shelter in the time of storm.
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling shade on the burning sand,
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band-
A shelter in the time of storm.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The raging storms may round us beat,
A shelter in the time of storm;
We'll never leave our safe retreat,
A shelter in the time of storm.
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling shade on the burning sand,
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band-
A shelter in the time of storm.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Be Thou our helper ever near,
A shelter in the time of storm.
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling shade on the burning sand,
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band-
A shelter in the time of storm.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
