We joyfully adore Thee
Till Thou appear Thy members here
Would sing like those in glory
We lift our hearts and voices
In blest anticipation
And cry aloud and give to God
The praise of our salvation{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}While in affliction's furnace
And passing through the fire
The love we praise
Which tries our ways
And ever brings us nigher
We lift our hearts exulting
In Thine almighty favor
The love divine which made us Thine
Shall keep us Thine forever{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou dost conduct Thy people
Safely through all temptations
Nor will we fear since Thou art near
The fire of tribulation
The world with sin and Satan
Display their strength before us
By Thee we shall break through them all
And join the heav'nly chorus{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}By faith we see the glory
Of which Thou dost assure us
The world despise for that high prize
Which Thou hast set before us
And may we counted worthy
To meet the Son from heaven
There see our Lord by all adored
To us in glory given{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
