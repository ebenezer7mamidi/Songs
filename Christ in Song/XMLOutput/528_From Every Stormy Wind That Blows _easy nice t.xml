From ev'ry swelling tide of woes
There is a calm a sure retreat
'Tis found beneath the mercy seat{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads
A place than all besides more sweet
It is the blood-bought mercy seat{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}there is a scene where spirits blend
Where friend holds fellowship with friend
Though parted far by faith they meet
Around one common mercy seat{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}There there on eagle's wings we soar
And time and sense seem all no more
And heaven comes down our souls to greet
And glory crowns the mercy seat{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
