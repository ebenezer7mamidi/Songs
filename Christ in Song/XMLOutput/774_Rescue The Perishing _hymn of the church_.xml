Care for the dying
Jesus is merciful
Jesus will save{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Rescue the perishing
Care for the dying
Snatch them in pity
From sin and the grave
Weep o'er the erring one
Lift up the fallen
Tell them of Jesus
The mighty to save{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Tho' they are slighting Him
Still He is waiting
Waiting the penitent
Child to receive
Plead with them earnestly
Plead with them gently
He will forgive
If they only believe{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Down in the human heart
Crushed by the tempter
Feelings lie buried
That grace can restore
Touched by a loving heart
Wakened by kindness
Chords that are broken
Will vibrate once more{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Rescue the perishing
Duty demands it
Strength for thy labor
The Lord will provide
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them
Tell the poor wanderer
A Saviour has died{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
