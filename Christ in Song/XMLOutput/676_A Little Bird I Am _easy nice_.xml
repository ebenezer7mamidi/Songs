Shut from the fields of air
And in my cage I sit and sing
To him who placed me there
Well pleased a prisoner to be
Because my God it pleaseth Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Nought have I else to do
I sing the whole day long
And He whom most I love to please
Doth listen to my song
He caught and bound my wandering wing
But still He bends to hear me sing{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou hast an ear to hear
A heart to love and bless
And though my notes were e'er so rude
Thou wouldst not hear the less
Because Thou knowest as they fall
That love sweet love inspires them all{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}My cage confines me round
Abroad I cannot fly
But though my wing is closely bound
My hearts at liberty
For prison walls cannot control
The flight - the freedom of the soul{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}O it is good to soar
These bolts and bars above
To Him whose purpose I adore
Whose providence I love
And in Thy mighty will to find
The joy the freedom of the mind{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
