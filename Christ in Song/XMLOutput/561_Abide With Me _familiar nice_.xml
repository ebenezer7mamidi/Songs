Fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens
Lord with me abide
When other helpers
Fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless
Oh abide with me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Swift to its close
Ebbs out life's little day
Earth's joys grow dim
Its glories pass away
Change and decay
In all around I see
O Thou who changest not
Abide with me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Come not in terrors
As the King of kings
But kind and good
With healing in Thy wings
Tears for all woes
A heart for every plea
Come Friend of sinners
Thus abide with me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I need Thy presence
Every passing hour
What but Thy grace
Can foil the tempter's power
Who like Thyself
My guide and stay can be
Through cloud and sunshine
Oh abide with me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I fear no foe
With Thee at hand to bless
Ills have no weight
And tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting
Where grave thy victory
I triumph still
If Thou abide with me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Reveal Thyself
Before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom
And point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks
And earth's vain shadows flee
In life - In death
O Lord abide with me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
