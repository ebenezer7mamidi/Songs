With milk and honey blest
Beneath thy contemplation
Sink heart and voice oppressed
I know not O I know not
What joys await us there
What radiance of glory
What bliss beyond compare{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}They stand those halls of Zion
All jubilant with song
And bright with many an angel
And all the martyr throng
The Prince is ever in them
The daylight is serene
The pastures of the blessed
Are decked in glorious sheen{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There is the throne of David
And there from care released
The song of them that triumph
The shout of them that feast
And they who with their Leader
Have conquered in the fight
Forever and forever
Are clad in robes of white{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O sweet and blessed country
The home of God's elect
O sweet and blessed country
That eager hearts expect
Jesus in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest
Who art with God the Father
And Spirit ever blest{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
