Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty,
At Calvary.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He died
On Calvary.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}By God’s Word at last my sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law I’d spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring turned
To Calvary.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Now I’ve giv’n to Jesus everything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan!
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
