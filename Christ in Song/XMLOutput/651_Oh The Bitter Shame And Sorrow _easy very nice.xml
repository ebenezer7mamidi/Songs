That a time could ever be
When I let the Saviour's pity
Plead in vain and proudly answered
'All of self and none of Thee
All of self and none of Thee'{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Yet He found me I beheld Him
Bleeding on the cursed tree
Heard Him pray 'Forgive them Father'
And my wistful heart said faintly
'Some of self and some of Thee
Some of self and some of Thee'{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Day by day His tender mercy
Healing helping full and free
Sweet and strong and ah so patient
Brought me lower while I whispered
'Less of self and more of Thee
Less of self and more of Thee'{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Higher than the highest heavens
Deeper than the deepest sea
Lord Thy love at last hath conquered
Grant me now my souls petition
'None of self and all of Thee
None of self and all of Thee'{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
