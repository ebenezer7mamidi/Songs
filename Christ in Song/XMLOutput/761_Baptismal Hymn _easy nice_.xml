In spirit here we stand
With hearts all full of praises
To keep Thy blest command
Our souls by faith rejoicing
To trace Thy path of love
Down through death's angry billows
Up to the throne above{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord Jesus we remember
The travail of Thy soul
When through Thy love's deep pity
The waves did o'er Thee roll
Baptized in death's dark waters
For us Thy blood was shed
For us Thou Lord of Glory
Wast numbered with the dead{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O Lord Thou now art risen
Thy travail all is o'er
For sin Thou once hast suffered
Thou liv'st to die no more
Sin death and hell are vanquished
By Thee the Church's Head
And lo we share Thy triumphs
Thou First-born from the dead{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Unto Thy death baptized
We one with Thee we died
With Thee our Life we're risen
And shall be glorified
From sin the world and Satan
We're ransomed by Thy blood
And here would walk as strangers
Alive with Thee to God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
