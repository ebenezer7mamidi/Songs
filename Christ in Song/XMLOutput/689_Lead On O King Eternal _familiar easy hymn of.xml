The day of march has come
Henceforth in fields of conquest
Thy tents shall be our home
Thro' days of preparation
Thy grace has made us strong
And now O King eternal
We lift our battle song{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Lead on O King Eternal
To lands of deepest night
We follow where Thou leadest
As heralds of the light
May we to souls immortal
Thy Word of life convey
And open heaven's portal
Through Christ the truth the way{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Lead on O King Eternal
We follow not with fears
For gladness breaks like morning
Where'er Thy face appears
Thy cross is lifted o'er us
We journey in its light
The crown awaits the conquest
Lead on O God of might{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
