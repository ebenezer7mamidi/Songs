verse1
We may not die,
but rise and meet the Lord!
This blessed hope, God show us in His Word;
The Spirit makes
It plain to us His own-
He'll catch us from this world to His own throne{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We may not die,
but rise and meet the Lord!
Oh, the bright glory
These few words afford!
Changed instantly,
The twinkling of an eye,
And see Thee face to face,
Our Lord for aye!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Some shall not die,
But rise and meet the Lord,
O precious promise!
Faithful, true, and good!
Although we do not
Know the day or hour,
We know that He Himself
Shall come in power.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}We may not die,
Then let us more pure be,
Cut off each sin,
Unseen, or that men see,
This world is passing,
Heaven will quickly come,
Then let us day by day be more like Him!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}We shall arise,
And meet Him in the air!
Then let us not
Entangled be down here!
We look for Christ!
We do not look for death!
Our hope at any hour,
To leave this earth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}We shall arise,
And to our Lord ascend,
When His victorious
Shout the air shall rend!
O come! Lord Jesus
Come!
His saints now cry,
Come quickly!
So, we e'er shall be with Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
