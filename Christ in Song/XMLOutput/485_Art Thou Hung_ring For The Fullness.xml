Of the blessing Christ doth give
Longing now to learn the secret
Of the life he bids thee live
In His word thine answer standeth
"Christ who is our Life" it saith
Open now thy heart and trust Him
There to dwell henceforth by faith{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Christ the Lord's Anointed reigning
O'er the life He died to win
Daily shall reveal more fully
His great power without within
What thou never could'st accomplish
Shall His Spirit work through thee
While thy soul this witness beareth
'Tis not I but Christ in me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In Him dwelleth all God's fullness
In Him thou art made complete
Rise and claim thy heavenly birthright
Kneeling at thy Father's feet
He will never disappoint thee
Praise Him that the gift is thine
Then go forth to live each moment
On sufficiency divine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord I come and simply resting
On Thy faithful changeless word
I believe the blood doth cleanse me
And that Christ is crowned Lord
Grant henceforth a ceaseless outflow
Of Thy life and love through me
Reaching those who sit in darkness
Winning priceless souls to Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
