Lest I lose the loving Presence
And Delight I knew before.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight,
I can see in paradise,
But while here on earth His mercy
For my blindness will suffice.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I no more would be delivered
From my thorn, but look for grace,
While within the veil His glory
Shineth brightly on my face.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}In the deep dark night, His beauty
I by faith, not sight, may trace;
He was ridiculed and hated,
Yet I see His glorious face.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Sun and moonlight far surpassing,
Clouds and Milky Way o’erspread,
Is the glory all transcending
Shining from His thorn-crowned head.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
