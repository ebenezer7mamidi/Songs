Home! Home sweet home
A welcome from Jesus
Awaits us at Home{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}He looked for a city and lived in a tent
A pilgrim to glory right onward he went
God's promise his solace so royal his birth
No wonder he sought not the glories of earth{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He looked for a city his God should prepare
No mansion on earth could he covet or share
For had not God told him that royal abode
Awaited His pilgrims who kept to the road{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}He looked for a city if sometimes he sighed
To be trudging the road all earth's glory denied
The thought of that city changed sighing to song
For the road might be rough but it could not be long{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}He looked for a city his hope Lord we share
And know that bright city which Thou dost prepare
We'll dwell in forever since willing to be
Just pilgrims with Jesus our roof a tent tree{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
