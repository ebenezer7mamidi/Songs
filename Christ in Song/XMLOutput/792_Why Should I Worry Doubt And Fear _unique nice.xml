Has God not caused
His Son to bear
my sins upon the tree
The debt that Christ for me has paid
Would God demand it be repaid
And claim again from me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Redemption full the Lord has made
And all my debts has fully paid
From law to set me free
I fear not for the wrath of God
For I've been sprinkled with His blood
It wholly covers me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}For me forgiveness He has gained
And full acquittal was obtained
All debts of sin are paid
God would not have His claim on two
First on His Son my Surety true
And then upon me laid{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}So now I have full peace and rest
My Savior Christ hath done the best
And set me wholly free
By His all-efficacious blood
I ne'er could be condemned by God
For He has died for me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
