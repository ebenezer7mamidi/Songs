Day in the Word foretold
When mid the scenes triumphant
Long'd for by saints of old
He who on earth a stranger
Travers'd its paths of pain
Jesus the Prince the Savior
Comes evermore to reign{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Work for the Day is coming
Darkness will soon be gone
Then o'er the night of weeping
Day without end shall dawn
What now we sow in sadness
Then we shall reap in joy
Hope will be changed to gladness
Praise be our blest employ{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Work for the Day is coming
Made for the saints of light
Off with the garments dreary
On with the armor bright
Soon will the strife be ended
Soon all our toils below
Not to the dark we're tending
But to the Day we go{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Work for the Lord is coming
Children of light are we
From Jesus' birght appearing
Powers of darkness flee
Out of the mist at His bidding
Souls like the dew are born
O'er all the East are spreading
Tints of the rosy morn{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Work then the Day is coming
No time for sighing now
Harps for the hands once drooping
Wreaths for the victor's brow
Now morning Light is breaking
Soon will the Day appear
Night shades appall no longer
Jesus our Lord is near{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
