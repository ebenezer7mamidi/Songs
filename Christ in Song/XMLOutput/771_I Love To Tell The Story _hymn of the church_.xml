'Twill be my theme in glory
To tell the old old story
Of Jesus and His love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I love to tell the story
Of unseen things above
Of Jesus and His glory
Of Jesus and His love
I love to tell the story
Because I know 'tis true
It satisfies my longings
As nothing else can do{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I love to tell the story
More wonderful it seems
Than all the golden fancies
Of all my golden dreams
I love to tell the story
It did so much for me
And that is just the reason
I tell it now to thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I love to tell the story
'Tis pleasant to repeat
What seems each time I tell it
More wonderfully sweet
I love to tell the story
For some have never heard
The message of salvation
From God's own holy Word{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I love to tell the story
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it like the rest
And when in scenes of glory
I sing the new new song
'Twill be the old old story
That I have loved so long{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
