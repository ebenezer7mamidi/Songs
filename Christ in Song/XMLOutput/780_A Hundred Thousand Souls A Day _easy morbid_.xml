Fast away in thousands day by day
They're passing to their doom
They're passing to their doom{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}A hundred thousand souls a day
Are passing one by one away
In Christ-less guilt and gloom
Without one ray of hope or light
With future dark as endless night
They're passing to their doom
They're passing to their doom{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O Holy Ghost Thy people move
Baptize their hearts with faith and love
And consecrate their gold
At Jesus' feet their millions pour
And all their ranks unite once more
As in the days of old
As in the days of old{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The master's coming draweth near
The Son of Man will soon appear
His kingdom is at hand
But ere that glorious day can be
This gospel of the kingdom we
Must preach in every land
Must preach in every land{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh let us then His coming haste
Oh let us end this awful waste
Of souls that never die
For many millions still are lost
A Savior's blood has paid the cost
Oh hear their dying cry
Oh hear their dying cry{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Armies of pray'r your promise claim
Prove the full pow'r of Jesus' name
And take the victory
Your conq'ring Captain leads you on
The glorious fight may still be won
This very century
This very century{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
