Like the wideness of the sea;
There’s a kindness in His justice,
Which is more than liberty.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}There is welcome for the sinner,
And more graces for the good;
There is mercy with the Savior;
There is healing in His blood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There is plentiful redemption
In the blood that has been shed;
There is joy for all the members
In the sorrows of the Head.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}For the love of God is broader
Than the measure of our mind;
And the heart of the eternal
Is most wonderfully kind.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}If our love were but more simple,
We should take Him at His word;
And our lives would be all sunshine
In the sweetness of our Lord.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
