Hearts are fully blest
Finding as He promised
Perfect peace and rest{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Like a river glorious
Is God's perfect peace
Over all victorious
In its bright increase
Perfect yet it floweth
Fuller every day
Perfect yet it groweth
Deeper all the way{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Hidden in the hollow
Of His blessed hand
Never foe can follow
Never traitor stand
Not a surge of worry
Not a shade of care
Not a blast of hurry
Touch the Spirit there{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Every joy or trial
Falleth from above
Traced upon our di-al
By the Son of Love
We may trust Him fully
All for us to do
They who trust Him wholly
Find Him wholly true{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
