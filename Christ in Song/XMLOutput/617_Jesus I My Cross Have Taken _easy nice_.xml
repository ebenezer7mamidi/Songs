All to leave and follow Thee
Destitute despised forsaken
Thou from hence my all shalt be
Perish every fond ambition
All I've sought and hoped and known
Yet how rich is my condition
God and heaven are still my own{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Let the world despise and leave me
They have left my Savior too
Human hearts and looks deceive me
Thou art not like man untrue
And while Thou shalt smile upon me
God of wisdom love and might
Foes may hate and friends may shun me
Show Thy face and all is bright{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Man may trouble and distress me
'Twill but drive me to Thy breast
Life with trials hard may press me
Heav'n will bring me sweeter rest
O 'tis not in grief to harm me
While Thy love is left to me
O 'twere not in joy to charm me
Were that joy unmixed with Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Go then earthly fame and treasure
Come disaster scorn and pain
In Thy service pain is pleasure
With Thy favor loss is gain
I have called Thee Abba Father
I have stayed my heart on Thee
Storms may howl and clouds may gather
All must work for good to me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Haste thee on from grace to glory
Armed by faith and winged by prayer
Heaven's eternal days before thee
God's own hand shall guide thee there
Soon shall close thy earthly mission
Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days
Hope shall change to glad fruition
Faith to sight and prayer to praise{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
