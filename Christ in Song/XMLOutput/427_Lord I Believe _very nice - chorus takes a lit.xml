Saviour raise my faith in Thee
Till it can move a mountain
Lord I believe - Lord I believe
All my doubts are buried
In the Fountain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}When sorrows and storms
Are besetting my track
And Satan is whisp'ring
You'd better turn back
Oh then I have proved it
Tho' dark be the way
A little believing
Drives clouds right away{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}How easy when sailing
The sea at a calm
To trust in the strength
Of Jehovah's great arm
But somehow I find
When the waves swamp the boat
It takes some believing
To keep things afloat{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I'll stand to the end
I have heard people say
I'll fight till I die
And I'll ne'er run away
But when the temptations
So fiercely assailed
They left off believing
And terribly failed{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}And others there are
Full of courage and zeal
Who go to the battle
Like warriors of steel
But right in the heat
Of the conflict with sin
Instead of believing
They faint and give in{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh let us remember
In running our race
That faith is not feeling
And trust is not trace
And when all is seeming
As black as the night
We'll keep on believing
And go on with the fight{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
