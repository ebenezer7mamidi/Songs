Thou Giver of all good.
E’en heav’n itself no richer knows
Than Jesus and His blood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Faith, too, that trusts in Him through grace,
From that same love we gain;
Else, sweetly as it suits our case,
The gift had been in vain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O Love devine, Thou vast abyss
Our sins buried in thee,
Cover'd is our unrighteousness,
From all debts we are free{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}In Jesus blood our hearts can trace
The footprints of Thy love
And know the riches of Thy grace
The holy righteousness.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Though heart may fail and flesh decay,
On firm ground we remain,
When earth and heav'n shall pass away,
Our anchor shall sustain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Until that day, we then shall prove,
The full worth of Thy love.
But here on earth, my life still needs
Thy great sustaining power.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,
To Thee our all we owe:
The precious Savior, and the power
That makes Him precious too.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
