Unawed by shame or fear,
Till a new object struck my sight,
And stopped my wild career.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I saw One hanging on a tree,
In agony and blood,
Who fixed His languid eyes on me,
As near His cross I stood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Sure, never to my latest breath,
Can I forget that look;
It seemed to charge me with His death,
Though not a word He spoke.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}My conscience felt and owned the guilt,
And plunged me in despair,
I saw my sins His blood had spilt,
And helped to nail Him there.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Alas! I knew not what I did,
But now my tears are vain;
Where shall my trembling soul be hid?
For I the Lord have slain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}A second look He gave, which said,
I freely all forgive;
This blood is for thy ransom paid;
I die, that thou mayâ€™st live.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Thus, while His death my sin displays,
In all its blackest hue,
Such is the mystery of grace,
It seals my pardon too.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}With pleasing grief and mournful joy,
My spirit now is filled;
That I should such a life destroy,
Yet live by Him I killed.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
