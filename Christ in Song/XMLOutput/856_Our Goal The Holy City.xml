It is our portion 'tis where He's adored
Although our bodies still are living here
Our spirits with our glorious Lord are there
Our spirits with our glorious Lord are there{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Our goal divine the new Jerusalem
That holy city made for God with men
For all redeemed who have Thy pathway trod
Shall have the right to share the bliss with God
Shall have the right to share the bliss with God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}And every time we toward that city gaze
Then every time we long to see Thy face
We long to hear the shout that calls to Thee
With Thee to share Thy God eternally
With Thee to share Thy God eternally{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Our heart's desire is not the peace so sweet
Our longed for hope is not the joy we'll meet
But Thou Thyself Thou art "our hope" O Lord
For 'tis Thyself that will be our reward
For 'tis Thyself that will be our reward{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}O Jesus Lord we pray Thee hear our cry
Come bring us to that city from on high
That in that glory we may share with Thee
Thy loving Self partake eternally
Thy loving Self partake eternally{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}O Lord Thou sayest "I make all things new"
New heav'ns new earth and all within them
Our God Himself our portion then shall be
O Lord come quickly take us up with Thee
O Lord come quickly take us up with Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
