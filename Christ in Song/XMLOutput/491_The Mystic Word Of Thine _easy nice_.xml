O sov'reign Lord
Is all too pure
Too high - too deep for me
Weary of striving
And with longing faint
I breathe it back again
In pray'r to Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Abide in me I pray
And I in Thee
From this good hour
O leave me nevermore
Then shall the discord cease
The wound be healed
The life-long bleeding
Of the soul be o'er{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Abide in me
O'ershadow by Thy love
Each half-formed purpose
And dark thought of sin
Quench e'er it rise
Each selfish low desire
And keep my soul as Thine
Calm and divine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}As some rare perfume
In a vase of clay
Pervades it with a fragrance
Not its own
So when Thou dwellest
In a mortal soul
All heaven's own sweetness
Seems around it thrown{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}The soul alone
Like a neglected harp
Grows out of tune
And needs that Hand divine
Dwell Thou within it
Tune and touch the chords
Till every note and string
Shall anwer Thine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Abide in me
There have been moments blest
When I have heard Thy voice
And felt Thy power
Then evil lost its grasp
And passion hushed
Owned the divine
Enchantment of the hour{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}These were but seasons
Beautiful and rare
Abide in me
And they shall ever be
Fulfill at once
Thy precept and my prayer
Come and abide in me
And I in Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
