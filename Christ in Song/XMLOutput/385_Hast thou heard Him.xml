Worthy tribute haste to bring;
Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
Crown Him now unrivaled King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?
Is not thine a captured heart?
Chief among ten thousand own Him;
Joyful choose the better part.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,
Lovely things of time and sense;
Gilded thus does sin disarm thee,
Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}What has stripped the seeming beauty
From the idols of the earth?
Not a sense of right or duty,
But the sight of peerless worth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Not the crushing of those idols,
With its bitter void and smart;
But the beaming of His beauty,
The unveiling of His heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Who extinguishes their taper
Till they hail the rising sun?
Who discards the garb of winter
Till the summer has begun?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}’Tis that look that melted Peter,
’Tis that face that Stephen saw,
’Tis that heart that wept with Mary,
Can alone from idols draw:{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Draw and win and fill completely,
Till the cup o’erflow the brim;
What have we to do with idols
Who have companied with Him?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
