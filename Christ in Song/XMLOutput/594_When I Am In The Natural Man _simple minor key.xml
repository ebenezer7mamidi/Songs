How very strong I feel I am
I do not know
I cannot scan
How very weak I am{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When in the world I have my life
I cannot sense my failure rife
But boasting in my earnest strife
Proudly I forward press{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When I within the darkness dwell
My shallow state I cannot tell
I only think how I excel
Needing no modesty{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}But when at last I come to Thee
Thy searching light uncovers me
I see what I could never see
My ugly self exposed{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Withering beneath Thy scorching ray
I find my all fading away
My self-esteem in dust I lay
My weakness I embrace{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}There's not a thing that pride can claim
There's not a member but is lame
There's only deep regret and shame
O Lord how can I pray{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy blood from judgement sets me free
Thy life from doom delivers me
How filthy yet I still must be
In shame my head I bow{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}In blindness I'm puffed up with pride
Thinking no need the facts to hide
My self-conceit has multiplied
While I in darkness boast{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v9"><lines>{lang-eng}Whether I stay or move along
Whate'er I say I'm always wrong
So weak am I and never strong
Nothing I do is right
10. I want to pray but faith have not
I fain would seek Thee as Thou art
Oh canst Thou e'er renew my heart
Have mercy Lord on me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
