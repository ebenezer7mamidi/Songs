That in Thy meekness used to shine;
That lit Thy lonely pathway, trod
In wondrous love, O Son of God!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, who like Thee, so calm, so bright,
So pure, so made to live in light?
Oh, who like Thee did ever go
So patient through a world of woe?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O, who like thee so humbly bore
The scorn, the scoffs, of men before?
So meek, forgiving, godlike, high,
So glorious in humility?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}E'en death, which sets the prisoner free,
Was pang and scoff and scorn to thee;
Yet love through all thy torture glowed,
And mercy with thy life-blood flowed.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, in Thy light be mine to go,
Illumining all my way of woe!
And give me ever on the road
To trace Thy footsteps, Son of God!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
