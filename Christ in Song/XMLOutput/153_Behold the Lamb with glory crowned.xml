To Him all pow’r is giv’n:
No place too high for Him is found,
No place too high in heav’n.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He fills the throne—the throne above;
Its rights to Him belong;
The object of His Father’s love,
Theme of the ransomed’s song.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Though high yet He accepts the praise
His people offer here;
The faintest, feeblest note they raise
Will reach the Savior’s ear.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}This song be ours, we join in one
To celebrate the Name
Of Him that sits upon the throne,

To Him be glory giv’n;
The crown is His, and His by right
The highest place in heav’n.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
