No Thought Can Reach, No Tongue Declare;
O Knit My Thankful Heart To Thee,
And Reign Without A Rival There!
Thine Wholly, Thine Alone, I Am,
Lord, with Thy love my heart in-flame.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O Grant That Nothing In My Soul
May Dwell, But Thy Pure Love Alone;
O May Thy Love Possess Me Whole,
My Joy, My Treasure, And My Crown!
Strange Flames Far From My Heart Remove;
My Every Act, Word, Thought, Be Love.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O Love, How Cheering Is Thy Ray!
All Pain Before Thy Presence Flies,
Care, Anguish, Sorrow, Melt Away,
Whereâ€™er Thy Healing Beams Arise;
O Jesu, Nothing May I See,
And naught desire, Or Seek, But Thee!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Still Let Thy Love Point Out My War;
How Wondrous Things Thy Love Hath Wrought!
Still Lead Me, Lest I Go Astray;
Direct My Word, Inspire My Thought;
And If I Fall, Soon May I Hear
Thy Voice, And Know That Love Is Near.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}In Suffering Be Thy Love My Peace,
In Weakness Be Thy Love My Power;
And When The Storms Of Life Shall Cease,
Jesus, In That eventful Hour,
In Death As Life Be Guide and Friend,
That I may love Thee without end.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
