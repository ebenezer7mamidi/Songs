Through all thy days
Fear not for He
Doth hold thy hand
Though dark thy way
Still sing and praise
Sometime - Sometime
We'll understand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Not now
But in the coming years
It may be in the better land
We'll read
The meaning of our tears
And there - sometime
We'll understand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We'll catch
The broken thread again
And finish
What we here began
Heav'n will the
Mysteries explain
And then - Ah then
We'll understand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}We'll know
Why clouds instead of sun
Were over
Many a cherished plan
Why song has ceased
When scarce begun
'Tis there sometime
We'll understand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Why what
We long for most of all
Eludes so oft our eager hand
Why hopes are crushed
And castles fall
Up there - sometime
We'll understand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}God knows the way
He hold the key
He guides us with
Unerring hand
Sometime with tearless
Eyes we'll see
Yes there - up there
We'll understand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
