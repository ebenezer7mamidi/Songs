But where can it be found?
Only, dear Saviour in Thy grace,
Where purest joys abound.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}A moment's space without God
Creates in me a hell;
But when He sheds His love abroad,
What raptures do I feel!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord, if a transient sight of Thee
Affords us such a feast,
How glorious will that vision be,
Which shall forever last?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}When shall we, Lord, Thy glory see
In light without a shade,
The glort which surrounded Thee
Before the world was made?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}What cares, infirmities and pains
Oppress our feeble frame?
Immortal health and vigor reigns
In presence if the Lamb.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}We now but darkly thro' the glass
Behold the God we own;
Then shall we see Him face to face,
And know as we are known.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Then satan with his fiery darts
Shall us no more molest;
His arrows cannot reach our hearts
When we in glory rest.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}The world shall no more charm eyes,
Nor captive our hearts,
Our soluls to nobler pleasures rise,
Which God Himself imparts.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
