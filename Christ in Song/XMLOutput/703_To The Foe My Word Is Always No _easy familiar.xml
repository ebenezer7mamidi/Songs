To the Father it is "Yes"
That His plan and all His counsel
Be accomplished with success
When Thine orders I'm obeying
Grant me Lord authority
To fulfill Thy plan eternal
Thru the Spirit's power in me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}To the foe my word is always "No"
To the Father it is "Yes"
'Tis my attitude eternal
May the Lord protect and bless
Lest while walking in obedience
Satan undermine the way
When I'm list'ning to Thine orders
Grant me mercy Lord I pray{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}To the foe my word is always "No"
To the Father it is "Yes"
I completely would obey Him
Though deep suffring may oppress
If the Lord will save and keep me
As I forward press with Him
Then no trials shall prevent me
Nor will opposition grim{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
