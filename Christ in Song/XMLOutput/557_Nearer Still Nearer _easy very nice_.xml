Close to Thy heart
Draw me my Saviour
So precious Thou art
Fold me oh fold me
Close to Thy breast
Shelter me safe
In that haven of rest
Shelter me safe
In that haven of rest{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Nearer still nearer
Nothing I bring
Naught as an off'ring
To Jesus my King
Only my sinful
Now contrite heart
Grant me the cleansing
Thy blood doth impart
Grant me the cleansing
Thy blood doth impart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Nearer still nearer
Lord to be Thine
Sin with its follies
I gladly resign
All of its pleasures
Pomp and its pride
Give me but Jesus
My Lord crucified
Give me but Jesus
My Lord crucified{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Nearer still nearer
While life shall last
Till safe in glory
My anchor is cast
Thro' endless
Ages ever to be
Nearer my Saviour
Still nearer to Thee
Nearer my Saviour
Still nearer to Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
