What joy the blest assurance gives!
And now, before His Father, God,
Pleads the full merits of His blood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Repeated crimes awake our fears,
And Justice armed with frowns appears;
But in the Saviorâ€™s lovely face
Sweet Mercy smiles, and all is peace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Hence, then, ye black, despairing thoughts;
Above our fears, above our faults,
His mighty intercessions rise,
And guilt recedes, and terror dies.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}In every dark, distressful hour,
When sin and Satan join their power,
Let this dear hope repel the dart,
That Jesus bears us on His heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Great Advocate, almighty Friend!
On Him our humble hopes depend;
Our cause can never, never fail,
For Jesus pleads, and must prevail.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
