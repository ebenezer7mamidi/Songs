Speak oft with thy Lord
Abide in Him always
And feed on His Word
Make friends with God's children
Help those who are weak
Forgetting in nothing
His blessing to seek{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Take time to be holy
The world rushes on
Spend much time in secret
With Jesus alone
By looking to Jesus
Like Him thou shalt be
Thy friends in thy conduct
His likeness shall see{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Take time to be holy
Let Him be thy Guide
And run not before Him
Whatever betide
In joy or in sorrow
Still follow thy Lord
And looking to Jesus
Still trust in His Word{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Take time to be holy
Be calm in thy soul
Each tho't and each temper
Beneath His control
Thus led by His Spirit
To fountains of love
Thou soon shall be fitted
For service above{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
