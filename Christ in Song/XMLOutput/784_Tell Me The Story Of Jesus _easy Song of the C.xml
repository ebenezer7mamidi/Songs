Write on my heart every word
Tell me the story most precious
Sweetest that ever was heard{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Tell me the story of Jesus
Write on my heart every word
Tell me the story most precious
Sweetest that ever was heard
Tell how the angels in chorus
Sang as they welcomed His birth
Glory to God in the highest
Peace and good tidings to earth{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Fasting alone in the desert
Tell of the days that are past
How for our sins He was tempted
Yet was triumphant at last
Tell of the years of His labour
Tell of the sorrow He bore
He was despised and afflicted
Homeless rejected and poor{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Tell of the cross where they nailed Him
Writhing in anguish and pain
Tell of the grave where they laid Him
Tell how He liveth again
Love in that story so tender
Clearer than ever I see
Stay let me weep while you whisper
Love paid the ransom for me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
