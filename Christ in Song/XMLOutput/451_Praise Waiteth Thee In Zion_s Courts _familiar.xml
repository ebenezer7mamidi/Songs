Where Thy beloved dwell
Ransomed redeemed from Satan's thrall
Their Hallelujahs swell
Come Blessed Holy Ghost today
Our songs of praise inspire
Purge the iniquity
And touch our lips with living fire{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Praise for what
Thou our God hast wrought
For promised blessings ours
The cloud on faith's horizon seen
The pentecostal showers
Praise for Thine own
Right way dear Lord
We did not understand
But as Thy plans unfolded lie
We see Thy guiding hand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Enlarge our soul's capacity
Cut deeper channels Lord
Room for the floods
Of blessing now
According to Thy Word
E'en while we praise
The heavens rend
In power come from on high
Make this another Pentecost
Answer our spirit's cry{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
