Amen, so let it be;
Life from the dead is in that word,
'Tis immortality.
Here in the body pent, absent from Him I roam,
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
A day's march nearer home.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}My Father's house on high,
Home of my soul, how near
At times to faith's forseeing eye
Thy golden gates appear!
Ah! Then my spirit faints
To reach the land I love,
The bright inheritance of saints,
Jerusalem above.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}"Forever with the Lord!"
Father, if 'tis Thy will,
The promise of that faithful word
E'en here to me fulfill.
Be Thou at my right hand,
Then I can never fail;
Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand;
Fight, and I must prevail.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}So when my latest breath
Shall rend the veil in twain,
By death I shall escape from death,
And life eternal gain.
That resurrection-word,
That shout of victory;
Once more,"Forever with the Lord!"
Amen, so let it be!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
