Of our life's wild restless sea
Day by day His sweet voice soundeth
Saying Christian follow Me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}As of old apostles heard it
By the Galilean lake
Turned from home and toil and kindred
Leaving all for His dear sake

Of the vain world's golden store
From each idol that would keep us
Saying Christian love Me more{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In our joys and in our sorrows
Days of toil and hours of ease
Still He calls in cares and pleasures
Christian love Me more than these{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus calls us by Thy mercies
Saviour may we hear Thy call
Give our hearts to Thine obedience
Serve and love Thee best of all{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
