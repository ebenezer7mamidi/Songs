Fear I cannot know
Anywhere with Jesus
I can safely go{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Anywhere with Jesus
I can safely go
Anywhere He leads me
In this world below
Anywhere without Him
Dearest joys would fade
Anywhere with Jesus
I am not afraid{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Anywhere with Jesus
I am not alone
Other friends may fail me
He is still my own
Though His hand may lead me
Over dreary ways
Anwhere with Jesus
Is a house of praise{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Anywhere with Jesus
I can go to sleep
When the darkling shadows
Round about me creep
Knowing I shall waken
Never more to roam
Anywhere with Jesus
Will be home sweet home{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
