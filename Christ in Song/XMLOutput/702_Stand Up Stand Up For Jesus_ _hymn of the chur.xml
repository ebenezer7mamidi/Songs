You soldiers of the cross
Lift high His royal banner
It must not suffer loss
From victory unto victory
His army He shall lead
Till every foe is vanquished
And Christ is Lord indeed{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Stand up stand up for Jesus
The trumpet-call obey
Forth to the mighty conflict
In this His glorious day
Ye that are men now serve Him
Against unnumbered foes
Let courage rise with danger
And strength to strength oppose{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Stand up stand up for Jesus
Stand in His strength alone
The arm of flesh will fail you
Ye dare not trust your own
Put on the gospel armor
And watching unto prayer
Where duty calls or danger
Be never wanting there{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Stand up stand up for Jesus
The strife will not be long
This day the noise of battle
The next the victor's song
To him that overcometh
A crown of life shall be
He with the King of glory
Shall reign eternally{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
