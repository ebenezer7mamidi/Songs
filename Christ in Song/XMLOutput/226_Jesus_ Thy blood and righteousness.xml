My beauty are, my glorious dress:
â€™Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
With joy shall I lift up my head.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord, I believe the precious blood
Which at the mercy-seat of God
For ever doth for sinners plead,
For me, even for my soul, was shed.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord, I believe, were sinners more
Than sands upon the ocean shore,
You have for all a ransom paid,
For all a full atonement made.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Bold shall I stand in that great day;
For who aught to my charge shall lay?
Fully, by Thee, absolved I am
from sin and fear, from guilt and shame.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}This spotless robe the same appears
When ruined nature sinks in years:
No age can change its constant hue;
Its glory is forever new.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}O, let the dead now hear Thy voice;
Now bid Thy banished ones rejoice;
Their beauty this, their glorious dress,
Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou God of power, Thou God of love,
Let the whole world Thy mercy prove:
Their beauty this, their glorious dress,
Jesus the Lord, our righteousness.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
