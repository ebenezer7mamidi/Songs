To the Lord of all
Though the earth should totter
Though the heaven's should fall
Face e'en a disaster
With a faith-filled heart
Knowing naught can harm him
Who with Christ will start{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Can you be obedient
To the Lord you serve
Never even flinch friend
Never even swerve
Though your next step onward
Seem to lead to death
Can you then obey Him
Without bated breath{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Can you trust your Leader
When He bids you go
Right into a battle
With a mighty foe
Can you step up briskly
And with joy obey
Can you fight the battle
Till the end of day{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Can you?
Then beloved
Christ just waits for you
Listen for His orders
Glad His will to do
Then when soldiers muster
At the set of sun
And your name is mentioned
Christ will say "Well done"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
