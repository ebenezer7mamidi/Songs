And Thy kingly crown
When Thou camest to earth for me
But in Bethlehem's home
Was there found no room
For Thy holy nativity
O come to my heart Lord Jesus
There is room in my heart for Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Heaven's arches rang
When the angels sang
Proclaiming Thy royal degree
But in lowly birth
Didst Thou come to earth
And in great humility
O come to my heart Lord Jesus
There is room in my heart for Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The foxes found rest
And the birds their nest
In the shade of the forest tree
But Thy couch was the sod
O Thou Son of God
In the deserts of Galilee
O come to my heart Lord Jesus
There is room in my heart for Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou camest O Lord
With the living word
That should set Thy people free
But with mocking scorn
And with crown of thorn
They bore Thee to Calvary
O come to my heart Lord Jesus
There is room in my heart for Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}When the heavens shall ring
And her choirs shall sing
At Thy coming to victory
Let Thy voice call me home
Saying - Yet there is room
There is room at My side for thee
My heart shall rejoice Lord Jesus
When Thou comest and callest me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
