With mildest radiance shine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}To spread the rays of heavenly light,
To give the mourner joy,
To preach glad tidings to the poor,
Was His divine employ.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}'Midst keen reproach and cruel scorn,
Patient and meek He stood.
