He on the cross must die,
Or mercy could not come
To ruined sinners nigh;
Yes, Christ, the Son of God, must bleed,
That sinners might from sin be freed.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Himself He could not save,
For justice must be done;
Our sins’ full weight must fall
Upon the sinless One;
For nothing less can God accept
In payment of that fearful debt.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Himself He could not save,
For He the Surety stood
For all who now rely
Upon His precious blood;
He bore the penalty of guilt
When on the cross His blood was spilt.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Himself He could not save,
What wondrous love is this!
In love Himself He gave,
There ne’er was love like His!
Such love should melt a heart of stone,
Till praise flows forth to Him alone!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Himself He could not save,
Love's stream too deeply flowed,
In love Himself He gave,
To pay the debt we owed.
Obedience to His Father's will,
And love to Him did all fulfil.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}And now exalted high: ---
A Prince and Saviour He,
That sinners might draw nigh
And drink of mercy free,
Of mercy now so richly shed,
For Jesus liveth who was dead.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
