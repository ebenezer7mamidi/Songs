(I am not my own - I am not my own)
I --- am not my own ---
(I am not my own - I am not my own)
I belong to Jesus
(I belong yes I belong to Jesus)
And I am not my own ---
(I am I am not my own - my own){/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Tell me not of earthly pleasures
Tempt me not with sordid gain
Mock me not with earth's illusions
Vex me not with honors vain
I am weaned from sinful idols
I am henceforth not my own
I have given my heart to Jesus
I belong to Him alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O the blessed rest it brings us
To belong to Christ alone
We can draw on all His fullness
When we've nothing of our own
Blessed Jesus take me own me
Make me keep me wholly Thine
Deign to find in me Thy portion
While I joy to call Thee mine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Weary soul give up the struggle
Cease at length thyself to own
Give yourself away to Jesus
And belong to Him alone
Once He gave His all to win thee
Now He asks as much of thee
All He has He fully gives thee
Let thy love His portion be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
