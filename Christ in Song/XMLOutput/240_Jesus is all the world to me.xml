My life, my joy, my all.
He is my strength from day to day;
Without Him I would fall.
When I am sad, to Him I go;
No other one can cheer me so.
When I am sad, He makes me glad;
He’s my Friend.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus is all the world to me,
My Friend in trials sore.
I go to Him for blessings, and
He gives them o’er and o’er.
He sends the sunshine and the rain;
He sends the harvest’s golden grain:
Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain—
He’s my Friend.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus is all the world to me,
And true to Him I’ll be.
Oh, how could I this Friend deny
When He’s so true to me?
Following Him I know I’m right;
He watches o’er me day and night.
Following Him by day and night,
He’s my Friend.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus is all the world to me,
I want no better friend.
I trust Him now; I’ll trust Him when
Life’s fleeting days shall end.
Beautiful life with such a Friend;
Beautiful life that has no end!
Eternal life, eternal joy,
He’s my Friend.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
