And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I’ve committed
Unto Him against that day.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I know not why God’s wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the Word,
Creating faith in Him.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I walk the vale with Him,
Or "meet Him in the air."{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
