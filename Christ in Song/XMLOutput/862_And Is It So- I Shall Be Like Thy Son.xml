Is this the grace which He for me has won?
Father of glory-
thought beyond all thought!-
In glory, to Him own blest likeness brought!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, Jesus, Lord, who loved me like Thee?
Fruit of Thy work, with Thee, too, there to see
Thy glory, Lord, while endles ages roll,
Myself the prize and travail of Thy soul.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Yet it must be: Thy love had not its rest
Were Thy redeemed not with Thee fully blest;
That love that gives not as the world, but shares
All it possesses with its loved co-heirs.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Nor I alone; Thy loved ones, all complete
In glory, round Thee here with joy shall meet;
All like Thee, for Thy glory like Thee, Lord,
Object supreme of all, by all adored.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
