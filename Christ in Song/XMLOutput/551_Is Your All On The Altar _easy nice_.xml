On the altar of sacrifice laid
Your heart does the Spirit control
You can only be blest
And have peace and sweet rest
As you yield Him your body and soul{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}You have longed for sweet peace
And for faith to increase
And have earnestly fervently prayed
But you cannot have rest
Or be prefectly blest
Until all on the altar is laid{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Would you walk
With the Lord in the light of His Word
And have peace
And contentment alway
You must do
His sweet will
To be free from all ill
On the altar
Your all you must lay{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh we never can know
What the Lord will bestow
Of the blessings
For which we have prayed
Till our body and soul
He doth fully control
And our all on the Altar is laid{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Who can tell
All the love
He will send from above
Oh how happy
Our heart will be made
Oh what fellowship sweet
We shall share
At His feet
When our all
On the altar is laid{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
