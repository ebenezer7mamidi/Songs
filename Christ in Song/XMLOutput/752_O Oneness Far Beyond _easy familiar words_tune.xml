Oneness all human and yet all Divine
Oneness which doth all oneneses excel
Which cannot be expressed by earthly sign{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}These bodies are the members of the Lord
Ours and yet His for use and honor too
In sympathy and love and sweet accord
So one that nought that oneness can undo{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In us that Spirit dwells that dwells in Him
The Spirit of the Father and the Son
Though poor the temple and the glory dim
Still does the Spirit claim it for His own{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O holy oneness between earth and heaven
Each is the other and yet not the same
Not fellowship alone to us is given
But unity of nature and of name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}He still the Son of God on yonder throne
And we the sons of earth yet dwelling here
Yet we with Him He with us truly one
As if one heart were ours one home one sphere{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Upon His holy throne these members yet
Shall all be seated in that day when He
The head of the great unity shall sit
With them to share one common royalty{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
