Weak and wounded sick and sore
Jesus ready waits to save you
Full of pity love and pow'r
He is able He is able
He is willing doubt no more
He is able He is able
He is willing doubt no more{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Now ye needy come and welcome
God's free bounty glorify
True belief and true repentance
Every grace that brings us nigh
Without money without money
Come to Jesus Christ and buy
Without money without money
Come to Jesus Christ and buy{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Let not conscience make you linger
Nor of fitness fondly dream
All the fitness He requireth
Is to feel your need of Him
This He gives you this He gives you
'Tis the Spirit's rising beam
This He gives you this He gives you
'Tis the Spirit's rising beam{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Come ye weary heavy laden
Bruised and ruined by the Fall
If you tarry till you're better
You will never come at all
Not the righteous not the righteous
Sinners Jesus came to call
Not the righteous not the righteous
Sinners Jesus came to call{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}View Him prostrate in the garden
On the ground your Maker lies
On the bloody tree behold Him
Hear Him cry before He dies
"It is finished!" "It is finished!"
Sinner will not this suffice
"It is finished!" "It is finished!"
Sinner will not this suffice{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Lo th'incarnate God ascended
Pleads the merit of His blood
Venture on Him venture wholly
Let no other trust intrude
None but Jesus none but Jesus
Can do helpless sinners good
None but Jesus none but Jesus
Can do helpless sinners good{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
