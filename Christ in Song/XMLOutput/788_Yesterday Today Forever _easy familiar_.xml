Jesus is the same
All may change but Jesus never
Glory to His name
Glory to His name
Glory to His name
All may change but Jesus never
Glory to His name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}O how sweet the glorious message
Simple faith may claim
Yesterday, today , forever
Jesus is the same
Still He loves to save the sinful
Heal the sick and lame
Cheer the mourner still the tempest
Glory to His name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He who was the friend of sinners
Seeks thee lost one now
Sinner come and at His footstool
Penitently bow
He who said,
"I'll not condemn thee Go and sin no more"
Speaks to thee that word of pardon
As in days of yore{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Oft on earth He healed the suff'rer
By His mighty hand
Still our sicknesses and sorrows
Go at His command
He who gave His healing virtue
To a woman's touch
To the faith that claims His fullness
Still will give as much{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}As of old He walked to Emmaus
With them to abide
So through all life's way He walketh
Ever near our side
Soon again we shall behold Him
Hasten Lord the day
But twill still be "this same Jesus"
As He went away{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
