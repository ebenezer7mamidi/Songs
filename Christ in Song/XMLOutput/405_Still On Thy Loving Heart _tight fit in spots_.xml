Jesus sweet Author of my joy and rest
O let me pour my sorrows cares and woes
Into Thy true and sympathizing breast
Thy love grows ne'er cold
But its pure flame
Seems every day
More strong and bright to glow
Thy truth remains eternally the same
Pure and unsullied as the mountain snow{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O what is other love compared with Thine
Of such high value such eternal worth
What is man's love compared with love divine
Which never changes in this changing earth
Love which in this cold world grows never cold
Love which decays not with the world's decay
Love which is young when all things else grow old
Which lives when heaven and earth shall pass away{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}How little love unchangeable and fixed
In this dark valley doth to man remain
With what unworthy motive is it mixed
How full of grief uncertainty and pain
Love is the object which attracts all eyes
We win it and already fear to part
A thousand rivals watch to seize the prize
And tear the precious idol from our heart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}But Thou in spite of our offences past
And those alas which still in us are found
Hast loved us Jesus with a love so vast
No span can reach it and no plummet sound
Though the poor love we give Thee in return
Should be extinguished Thine is ever true
Its vestal fire eternally doth burn
Though everlasting always fresh and new{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou who art ever ready to embrace
All those who truly after Thee inquire
Thou who hast promised in Thy heart a place
To all who love Thee and a place desire
O Lord when I am anxious and depressed
And dim with tears mine eyes can hardly see
O let me lean upon Thy faithful breast
Rejoicing that e'en I am loved by Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
