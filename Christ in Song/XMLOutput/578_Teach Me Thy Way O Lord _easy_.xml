Teach me Thy Way
Thy gracious aid afford
Teach me Thy Way
Help me to walk aright
More by faith less by sight
Lead me with heav'nly light
Teach me Thy Way{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When doubts and fears arise
Teach me Thy Way
When storms o'erspread the skies
Teach me Thy Way
Shine through the cloud and rain
Through sorrow toil and pain
Make Thou my pathway plain
Teach me Thy Way{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Long as my life shall last
Teach me Thy Way
Where'er my lot be cast
Teach me Thy Way
Until the race is run
Until the journey's done
Until the crown is won
Teach me Thy Way{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
