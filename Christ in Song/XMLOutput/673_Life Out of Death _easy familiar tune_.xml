Dear master is it spoken
Of the life here,
Or in a better land?
Nay, wherefore wait?
The vessel marred and broken
Shall now be molded
By the potters hand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Life out of death
O wonderous resurection!
Seed shown in conscious
Weakness raised in power
Thy life lived out in
Days of toil and friction
"Not I but Christ" in me
From hour to hour{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Life out of death
A Pilgrim path and lonely
Trodden by those who
Glory in the cross
They live in fellowship with
"Jesus Only"
And for His sake
Count earthly gain but loss{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Life out of death
Blessed mission to be ever
Bearing the living
Water brimming o'er
With life abundant
From the clear pure river
Telling that thirsty souls need
Thirst no more{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
