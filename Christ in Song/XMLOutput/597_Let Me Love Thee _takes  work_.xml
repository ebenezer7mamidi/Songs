Take my heart forever
Nothing but Thy favor
My soul can satisfy{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Let me love Thee Thou art claiming
Every feeling of my soul
Let that love in pow'r prevailing
Render Thee my life my all
For life's burdens they are easy
And life's sorrows lose their sting
If they're carried Lord to please Thee
If their pain Thy smile should win{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Let me love Thee - Come revealing
All Thy love has done for me
Help my heart so unbelieving
By the sight of Calvary
Let me see Thy love despising
All the shame my sins had brought
By Thy torments realizing
What a price my pardon bought{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Let me love Thee - I am gladdest
When I'm loving Thee the best
For in sunshine or in sadness
I can find in Thee a rest
But without Thee life is fading
Treasureless its choicest flowers
Taken are its gifts eternal
Left its empty passing hours{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Let me love Thee love is mighty
Swaying realms of deed and thought
By it I shall walk uprightly
I shall serve Thee as I ought
Love will soften every sorrow
Love will lighten every care
Love unquestioning will follow
Love will triumph love will dare{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
