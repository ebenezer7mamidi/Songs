But where Jesus leads the way
There the living waters flow
There our darkness turns to day{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Not our self-appointed task
Will the Lord's approval win
But the work we did not ask
Finished humbly just for Him{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Not the prayer we long to plead
When we bend before the Throne
But the touching deeper need
Of the Spirit's wordless groan{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Not the gift we proudly lay
On His altar will He heed
If our hearts have said Him "Nay"

In the heavenlies with the Lord
Thus we serve and pray and give
