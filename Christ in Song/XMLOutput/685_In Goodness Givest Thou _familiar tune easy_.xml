Thou In goodness takest
Who know Thy heart
O God can trust Thy hand
Wisely the vase Thou moldest
Weisely breakest
To trust is ours
'Tis Thine to understand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Our Father Thy great love
The cross hath told us
We know not all Thy way
But Thee we know
Thou gav'st Thy Son
No good will Thou withold us
'Tis love that lifts us up
That lays us low{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Not in the boons
Wherewith Thy good hand blesses
We rest here or in Heaven
Our home's Thy heart
Yet here as there
Wise love all power possesses
And all Thou dost is love
For love Thou art{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Not now Thy heart
Its purpose for us reaches
Another day is ours another place
Now love's deep wisdom
Disciplines and teaches
Then Thou shalt rest
And we see face to face{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}All the vast course of
Things love's plan is serving
Day - night - life - death
What men call good and ill
With power untiring
Purpose never swerving
Thou workest out Thy good
And perfect will{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}All things are Thine
All ours now and forever
Complex Thy work
But simple is Thy love
Well known though passing
Knowledge failing never
O peace and joy
And praise here and above{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
