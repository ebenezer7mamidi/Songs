The faithful followers of Jesus met
One was the hope of ev'ry waiting soul
And on one object great each heart was set{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}"With one accord" until the mighty gift
Of pentecostal power was outpoured
Then forth as witnesses possessed of God
To preach the resurrection of the Lord{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}"With one accord" within the house of God
A hallelujah song is daily raised
As with the voice of one from vocal hearts

Our cry goes up to Thee for "latter rain"
Unite Thy people as the "heart of one"
And pentecostal days shall come again{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
