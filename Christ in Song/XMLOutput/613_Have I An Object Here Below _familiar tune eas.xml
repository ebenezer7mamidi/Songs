Which would divide my heart with Thee
Which would divert its even flow
In answer to Thy constancy
Oh teach me quickly to return
And cause my heart afresh to burn{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Have I a hope however dear
Which would defer Thy coming Lord
Which would detain my spirit here
Where naught can lasting joy afford
From it my Savior set me free
To look and long and wait for Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Be Thou the object bright and fair
To fill and satisfy the heart
My hope to meet Thee in the air
And nevermore from Thee to part
That I may undistracted be
To follow serve and wait for Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
