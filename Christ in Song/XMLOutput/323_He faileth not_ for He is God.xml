He faileth not, His grace how good!
He faileth not, His Word is clear;
If we have God, whom need we fear?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The highest mount, He can make plain;
The wildest flood, He can restrain!
God of Impossibilities!
Poor puny man, now learn His ways.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The axe did swim on Jordan’s wave!
Our God the Red Sea’s waters clave!
He stopped the sun! made long the day!
This is the God to whom we pray.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}He bars the sea with feeble sand!
The proud waves bow at His command!
If God is thine, what more your need?
Can He not work for you indeed?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Our God is love; your needs are known;
His promises He’ll fully own.
Our gracious God bows down His ear
The feeblest, weakest cry to hear.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Our God is light, and never yet,
One promise did He e’er forget.
His promises in Christ the Son
Are fully pledged, Yea and Amen.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Our faithful God, faith cannot break,
Nor death, nor hell, His promise shake!
Who ask in faith, He’ll not deny;
His Word is sure, He must reply.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}He faileth not, let all men hear;
He faileth not, His Word is clear.
He faileth not, His grace how good;
He faileth not, for He is God!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
