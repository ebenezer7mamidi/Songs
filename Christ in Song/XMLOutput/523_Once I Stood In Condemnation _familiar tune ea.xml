Waiting thus the sinner's doom
Christ in death has wrought salvartion
God has raised Him
From the tomb
Once I was to God a stranger
Filled with enmity and fear
He has rescued me from danger
Love reveal'd and bro't me near
He has rescued me from danger
Love reveal'd and bro't me near{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Now I see in Christ's acceptance
But the measure of my own
He who lay beneath my sentence
Seated high upon the Throne
Quickened raised and in Him seated
I a full deliverance know
Every foe has been defeated
Every enemy laid low
Every foe has been defeated
Every enemy laid low
Now I have a life in union
With the risen Lord above
Now I drink in
Sweet communion
Some rich foretaste of His Love
Soon O Lord in highest glory
All it's vastness I'll explore
Soon I'll cast my crown
Before Thee
While I worship and adore
Soon I'll cast my crown
Before Thee
While I worship and adore{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
