Because of Calvary
Make me an overcomer,
A conqu'ror, A conqu'ror,
Lord, in Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I dare not be defeated,
With Calvary in view,
Where Jesus conquered Satan,
Where all His foes he slew.
Come, Lord, and give the vision
To nerve me for the fight,
Make me an overcomer
Clothed with Thy Spirit's might{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I dare not be defeated
Since Christ, my conquering King
Has called me to the battle
which He did surely win.
Come, lord, and give me courage,
Thy conqu'ring Spirit give,
Make me an overcomer,
In pow'r within me live{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I dare not be defeated,
When Jesus leads me on
To press through hellish regions
To share with Him His Throne
Come, Lord, and give Thy soldier
The pow'r to wield the sword,
Make me an overcomer
Through Thine inerrant Word{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I dare not be defeated,
Just at the set of sun,
When Jesus waits to whisper,
Well done, beloved, well done
Come, lord, bend from the Glory,
On me Thy Spirit cast,
Make me an overcomer,
A victor to the last{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
