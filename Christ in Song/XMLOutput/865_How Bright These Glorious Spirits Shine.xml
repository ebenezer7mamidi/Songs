Whence all their bright array?
How came they to the blissful seats
of everlasting day?
Lo! these are they from suf-f'rings
great who came to realms of light,
And in the blood of Christ have washed
those robes which shine so bright.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Now, with triumphal palms, they stand
Before the throne on high,
And serve the God they love,
Amidst the glories of the sky.
His presence fills each heart with joy,
Tunes ev'ry mouth to sing:
By day, by night, the sacred courts
With glad hosannas ring.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Hunger and thirst are felt no more,
Nor suns with scorching ray;
God is their Sun, whose cheering beams
Diffuse eternal day.
The Lamb which dwells amidst the throne
Shall o'er them still preside,
Feed them with nourishment divine,
And all their footsteps guide.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}'Mong pastures green He'll guide His flock
Where living streams appear;
And God the Lord from ev'ry eye
Shall wipe off every tear.
To Him who sits on the throne,
The God whom we all adore,
And to the Lamb that once was slain,
Be glory evermore!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
