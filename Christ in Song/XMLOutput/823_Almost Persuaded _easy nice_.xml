Now to believe
Almost persuaded
Christ to receive
Seems now some soul to say
Go Spirit go away
Some more convenient day
On Thee I'll call{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Almost persuaded
Come come today
Almost persuaded
Turn not away
Jesus invites you here
Angels are ling'ring near
Prayers rise from hearts so dear
O wand'rer come{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Almost persuaded
Harvest is past
Almost persuaded
Doom comes at last
Almost cannot avail
Almost is but to fail
Sad sad that bitter wail
Almost but lost{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
