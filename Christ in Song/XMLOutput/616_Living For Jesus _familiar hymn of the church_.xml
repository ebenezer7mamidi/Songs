I give myself to Thee
For Thou in Thy atonement
Didst give Thyself for me
I own no other master
My heart shall be Thy throne
My life I give henceforth to live
O Christ for Thee alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Living for Jesus a life that is true
Striving to please Him in all that I do
Yielding allegiance glad-hearted and free
This is the pathway of blessing for me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Living for Jesus who died in my place

Follow His leading and give Him my all{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Living for Jesus wherever I am
Doing each duty in His holy name
Willing to suffer affliction or loss
Deeming each trial a part of my cross{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Living for Jesus through earth's little while
My dearest treasure the light of His smile
Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem
Bringing the weary to find rest in Him{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
