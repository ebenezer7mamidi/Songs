Full salvation!
Lo, the fountain opened wide,
Streams through every land and nation
From the Savior’s wounded side.
Full salvation! Full salvation!
Streams an endless crimson tide.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, the glorious revelation!
See the cleansing current flow,
Washing stains of condemnation
Whiter than the driven snow:
Full salvation! Full salvation!
Oh, the rapturous bliss to know.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Love’s resistless current sweeping
All the regions deep within;
Thought, and wish, and senses keeping
Now, and every instant, clean:
Full salvation! Full salvation!
From the guilt and power of sin.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Life immortal, Christ descending,
Lo! my heart the Spirit’s shrine:
God and man in oneness blending,
Oh, what fellowship is mine!
Full salvation! Full salvation!
Raised in Christ to life divine!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Care and doubting, gloom and sorrow,
Fear and shame are mine no more;
Faith knows naught of dark tomorrow,
For my Savior goes before:
Full salvation! Full salvation!
Full and free for evermore!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
