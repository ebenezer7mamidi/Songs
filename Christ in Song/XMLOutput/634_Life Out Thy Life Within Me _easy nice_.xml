O Jesus King of kings
Be Thou Thyself the answer
To all my questionings
Live out Thy life within me
In all things have Thy way
I the transparent medium
Thy glory to display{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The temple has been yielded
And purified of sin
Let Thy shekinah glory
Now flash forth from within
And all the earth keep silence
The body henceforth be
Thy silent docile servant
Moved only as by Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Its members every moment
Held subject to Thy call
Ready to have Thee use them
Or not be used at all
Held without restless longing
Or strain or stress or fret
Or chafings at Thy dealings
Or thoughts of vain regret{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}But restful calm and pliant
From bend and bias free
Permitting Thee to settle
When Thou hast need of me
Live out Thy life within me
O Jesus King of kings
Be Thou the glorious answer
To all my questionings{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
