For this they keep me here
Imprisoned thus so long a time
For Him I hold so dear
And yet I am as when I came
The subject of this holy flame{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}How can I better grow
How from my own heart fly
Those who imprison me should know
True love can never die
Yet tread and crush it with disdain
And it will live and burn again{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}And am I then to blame
He's always in my sight
And having once inspired the flame
He always keeps it bright
For this they smite me and reprove
Because I cannot cease to love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}What power shall dim its ray
Dropped burning from above
Eternal life shall ne'er decay
God is the life of love
And when its source of life is o'er
And only then 'twill shine no more{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
