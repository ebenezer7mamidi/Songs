For each and all
Where men become
As children small
And little ones are great
Where love is all
The task and rule
The fee our all
And all at school
Small poor of low estate{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Where to unlearn
All things I learn
From self and
From all others turn
One Master hear and see
I learn and do
One thing alone
And wholly give
Myself to One
Who gives
Himself to me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}My task possessing
Nought to give
No life to have
Yet ever live
And ever losing gain
To follow
Knowing not the way
If He shall call
To answer
"Yea-all hail
All shame and pain"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Where silent
In His Holy Place
I look enraptured
On His Face
In glory undefiled
And know the
Heaven of His kiss
The doing nought
The simple bliss
Of being but a child{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Where find the school
To men unknown
Where time and place
Are past and gone
The hour is ever now
O soul
Thou needest ask no more
God tells thee
Of His open door
Still come
And harken thou{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
