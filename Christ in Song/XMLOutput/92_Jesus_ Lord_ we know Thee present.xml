At Thy table freshly spread,
Seated at Thy priceless banquet
With Thy banner overhead.
Precious moments at Thy table,
From all fear and doubt set free;
Here to rest, so sweetly able,
Occupied alone with Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Here rejoicing in Thy nearness,
Gladly by Thy Spirit led;
Calmly in the blest remembrance
Of Thyself, Thy blood once shed.
Lord, we take each simple token
In fond memory of Thee,
Muse upon Thy body broken
And Thy blood shed on the tree.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, what joy it is to see Thee,
In these chosen emblems here;
In the bread and wine of blessing—
Bread to strengthen, wine to cheer!
Lord, behold us met together,
One in Thee, our risen Head,
Thus we take the cup of blessing,
Thus we share the broken bread.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord, we know how true Thy promise
To be with us where we meet,
When in Thy loved name we gather
To enjoy communion sweet;
Dearer still that looked-for promise
To each waiting, yearning heart,
That with Thee we soon shall be, Lord,
Yes, “forever” where Thou art.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
