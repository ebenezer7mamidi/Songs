Safe on his gentle breast
There by His love o'er shaded
Sweetly my soul doth rest{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Safe in the arms of Jesus
Safe on His gentle breast
There by His love o'er shaded
Sweetly my soul doth rest
Hark - 'tis a song of heaven
Borne in a song to me
Over the fields of glory
Over the crystal sea{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Safe in the arms of Jesus
Safe from corroding care
Safe from the world's temptations
Sin cannot harm me there
Free from the blight of sorrow
Free from my doubts and fears
Only a few more trials
Only a few more tears{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus my heart's dear Refuge
Jesus has died for me
Firm on the Rock of Ages
Ever my trust shall be
Here let me wait with patience
Wait till the night is o'er
Wait till I see the morning
Break on the golden shore{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
