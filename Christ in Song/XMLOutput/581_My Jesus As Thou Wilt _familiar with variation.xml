Oh may Thy will be mine
Into Thy hand of love
I would my all resign
Through sorrow
Or through joy
Conduct me as Thine own
And help me still to say
My Lord Thy will be done{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}My Jesus as Thou wilt
Though seen through
Many a tear
Let not my star of hope
Grow dim or disappear
Since Thou on earth hast wept
And sorrowed oft alone
If I must weep with Thee
My Lord Thy will be done{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}My Jesus as Thou wilt
All shall be well for me
Each changing future scene
I gladly trust with Thee
Straight to my home above
I travel calmly on
And sing in life or death
My Lord Thy will be done{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
