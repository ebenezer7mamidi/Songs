For He deigns to walk with me;
And the glory of His presence will be mine eternally.
O the glory of His presence, O the beauty of His face;
I am His and His forever, He has won me by His grace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I have walked alone with Jesus
In a fellowship divine.
Never more can earth allure me,
I am His and He is mine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}On the mountain I have seen Him,
Christ my Comforter and Friend
And the glory of His presence
Will be with me to the end.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In my failure, sin, and sorrow,
Broken-hearted, crushed and torn,
I have felt His presence near me,
He has all my burdens borne.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}In the darkness, in the shadow,
With the Saviour I have trod,
Sweet indeed have been the lessons
Since Iâ€™ve walked alone with God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
