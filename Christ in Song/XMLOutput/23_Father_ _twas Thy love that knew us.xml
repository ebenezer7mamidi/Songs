Earth’s foundation long before:
That same love to Jesus drew us
By its sweet constraining pow’r,
And will keep us, and will keep us,
Safely now, and evermore,
Safely now, and evermore{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Now that changeless love enfolds us,
All its wealth on us bestows;
While its pow’r unchanging holds us
In a holy calm repose.
God and Father, God and Father,
Unto Thee our worship flows,
Unto Thee our worship flows.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}God of love, our souls adore Thee!
We would still Thy grace proclaim,
Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
And in glory praise Thy name;
Praise and worship, praise and worship
Be to God and to the Lamb!
Be to God and to the Lamb!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
