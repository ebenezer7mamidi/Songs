That Cross uplifted high,
With One, the Man of Sorrows,
Condemned to bleed and die.
O teach me what it cost Thee
To make a sinner whole;
And teach me, Savior, teach me
The value of a soul.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O teach me what it meaneth:
That sacred crimson tide,
The blood and water flowing
From Thine own wounded side.
Teach me that if none other
Had sinned, but I alone,
Yet still, Thy blood, O Jesus,
Thine only, must atone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O teach me what it meaneth,
Thy love beyond compare,
The love that reacheth deeper
Than depths of self-despair!
Yea, teach me, till there gloweth
In this cold heart of mine
Some feeble, pale reflection
Of that pure love of Thine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O teach me what it meaneth,
For I am full of sin;
And grace alone can reach me,
And love alone can win.
O teach me, for I need Thee,
I have no hope beside,
The chief of all the sinners
For whom the Savior died.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}O teach me what it meaneth:
The rest which Thou dost give
To all the heavy-laden
Who look to Thee and live.
Because I am a rebel
Thy pardon I receive:
Because Thou dost command me,
I can, I do believe.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}O infinite Redeemer,
I bring no other plea;
Because Thou dost invite me
I cast myself on Thee.
Because Thou dost accept me
I love and I adore;
Because Thy love constraineth,
Iâ€™ll praise Thee evermore.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
