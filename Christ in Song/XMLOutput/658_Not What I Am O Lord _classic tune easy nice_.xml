But what Thou art
That that alone can be
My soul's true rest
Thy love not mine
Bids fear and doubt depart
And stills the tempest
Of my tossing breast{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It is Thy perfect love
That casts out fear
I know the voice that speaks
The "It is I"
And in these well-known
Words of heavenly cheer
I hear the joy that bids
Each sorrow fly{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy Name is Love
I hear it from yon Cross
Thy Name is Love
I read it in yon tomb
All meaner love is
Perishable dross
But this shall light me through
Time's thickest gloom{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}It blesses now
And shall for ever bless
It saves me now
And shall for ever save
It holds me up
In days of helplessness
It bears me safely o'er
Each swelling wave{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}'Tis what I know of Thee
My Lord and God
That fills my soul with peace
My lips with song
Thou art my health my joy
My staff my rod
Leaning on Thee
In weakness I am strong{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}More of Thyself
Oh show me hour by hour
More of Thy glory
O my God and Lord
More of Thyself in all
Thy grace and power
More of Thy love and truth
Incarnate Word{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
