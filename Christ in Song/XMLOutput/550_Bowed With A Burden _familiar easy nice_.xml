None can weigh save Thee
Strength of my life on Thee
I cast my care
My heart must prove
Its own infirmity
But what shall move me
If my God be there{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh for a thankful song
With every breath
While amid fading flowers
And withering grass
I with Thee
Through the grave
And gate of death
On to my joyful
Resurrection pass{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Armed with the spirit
Of my Master's mind
How shall I spare
A thought that He would slay
Lord I would leave
Those things which are behind
And press toward
Heav'n through all
The narrow way{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Bright be my prospect
As I pass along
And ardent service
At the cost of all
Love by untiring
Ministry made strong
And ready for the first
The softest call{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Yes God is faithful
And my lot is cast
Oh not myself to serve
My own to be
Light of my life
The darkness now is past
And I beneath the Cross
Can work for Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
