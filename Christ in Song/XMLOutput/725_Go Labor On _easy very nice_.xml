Thy joy to do the Father's will
It is the way the Master went
Should not the servant tread it still{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Go labor on 'tis not for naught
Thy earthly loss is heav'nly gain
Men heed thee love thee praise thee not
The Master praises what are men{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Go labor on your hands are weak
Your knees are faint your souls cast down
Yet falter not - the prize you seek
Is near a kingdom and a crown{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Go labor on while it is day
The world's dark night is hastening on
Speed speed thy work cast sloth away
It is not thus that souls are won{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Men die in darkness at your side
Without a hope to cheer the tomb
Take up the torch and wave it wide
The torch that lights time's thickest gloom{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Toil on faint not keep watch and pray
Be wise the erring soul to win
Go forth into the world's highway
Compel the wand'rer to come in{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Toil on and in thy toil rejoice
For toil comes rest for exile home
Soon shalt Thou hear the Bridgroom's voice
The midnight cry - Behold I come{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
