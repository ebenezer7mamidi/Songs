A Bulwark never failing
Our Helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe
His craft and pow'r are great
And armed with cruel hate
On earth is not his equal{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Did we in our own strength confide
Our striving would be losing
Were not the right Man on our side
The Man of God's own choosing
Dost ask who that may be
Christ Jesus it is He
Lord Sabaoth His name
From age to age the same
And He must win the battle{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}And though this world with devils filled
Should threaten to undo us
We will not fear for God hath willed
His truth to triumph through us
The Prince of Darkness grim
We tremble not for him
His rage we can endure
For lo his doom is sure
One little word shall fell him{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}That word above all earthly pow'rs
No thanks to them abideth
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through Him who with us sideth
Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also
The body they may kill
God's truth abideth still
His kingdom is forever{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
