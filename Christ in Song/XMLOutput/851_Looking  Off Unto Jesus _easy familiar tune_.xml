And hearts that are sore
Look off unto Jesus
And sorrow no more
The light of His countenance
Shineth so bright
That on earth as in heaven
There need be no night{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Looking off unto Jesus
My Spirit is blest
In the world I have turmoil
In Him I have rest
The sea of my life
All about me may roar
When I look unto Jesus
I hear it no more{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Looking off unto Jesus
I go not astray
My eyes are on Him
And He shows me the way
The path may seem dark
As He leads me along
But following Jesus
I cannot go wrong{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Looking off unto Jesus
My heart cannot fear
Its trembling is still
When I see Jesus near
I know that His power
My safeguard will be
For "Why are you troubled"
He saith unto me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Soon, soon shall I know the Full beauty and grace
Of Jesus my Lord when I stand face to face
I shall know how His love Went before me each day
And wonder that ever My eyes turned away{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
