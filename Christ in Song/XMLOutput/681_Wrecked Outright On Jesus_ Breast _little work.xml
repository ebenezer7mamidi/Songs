Only wrecked souls thus can sing
Little boats that hug the shore
Fearing what the storm may bring
Never find on Jesus' breast
All that wrecked souls mean by rest{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Wrecked outright - So we lament
But when storms have done their worst
Then the soul surviving all
In Eternal arms is nursed
There to find that nought can move
One embosomed in such love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Wrecked outright - No more to own
E'en a craft to sail the sea
Still a voyager yet now
Anchored to Infinity
Nothing left to do but fling
Care aside and simply cling{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Wrecked outright - 'Twas purest gain
Henceforth other craft can see
That the storm may be a boon
That however rough the sea
God Himself doth watchful stand
For the wreck is in His hand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
