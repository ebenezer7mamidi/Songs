Few receive His cross
Many seek His consolation
Few will suffer loss
For the dear sake of the Master
Counting all by dross
For the dear sake of the Master
Counting all by dross{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Many sit at Jesus' table
Few will fast with Him
When the sorrow-cup of anguish
Trembles at the brim
Few watch with Him in the garden
Who have sung the hymn
Few watch with Him in the garden
Who have sung the hymn{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Many will confess His wisdom
Few embrace His shame
Many, should He smile upon them
Will His praise proclaim
Then, if for a while He leave them
They desert His name
Then, if for a while He leave them
They desert His name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}But the souls who love Him truly
Let woe come or bliss
These will count their dearest hearts' blood
Not their own, but His
Saviour, Thou who thus hast loved me
Give me love like this
Saviour, Thou who thus hast loved me
Give me love like this{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
