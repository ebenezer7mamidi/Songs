Thy path is o'er of shame and woe
For us so meekly trod:
All finished is Thy work of toil;
Thou reapest now the fruit and spoil,
Exalted by our God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy holy head, once bound with thorns,
The crown of glory now adorns,
Thy seat, the Father's throne:
O Lord, e'en now we sing Thy praise,
Ours the eternal song to raise,
Worthy the Lord alone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}As Head for us Thou sittest there,
Thy members here the blessing share,
Of all Thou dost receive:
Thy wisdom, riches, honours, powers,
Thy boundless love has all made ours,
Who in Thy name believe.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}We triumph in Thy triumphs, Lord;
Thy joys our deepest joys afford,
The fruit of love divine:
While sorrowing, suffering, toiling here,
How does the thought our spirits cheer,
The throne of glory's Thine!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
