Let me Thy glory see,
Draw my soul close to Thee,
Then speak in love to me -
Nothing between, Nothing between.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Let not earth's din and noise
Stifle Thy still small voice;
In it let me rejoice -
Nothing between, Nothing between.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Nothing of earthly care,
Nothing of tear or prayer,
No robe that self may wear -
Nothing between, Nothing between.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Unbelief disappear,
Vanish each doubt and fear,
Fading when Thou art near -
Nothing between, Nothing between.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Shine with unclouded ray,
Chasing each mist away,
O'er my whole heart bear sway -
Nothing between, Nothing between.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Thus may I walk with Thee,
Thee only may I see,
Thine only let me be -
Nothing between, Nothing between.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Till Thine eternal light,
Rising on earth's dark night,
Bursts on my open sight -
Nothing between, Nothing between.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
