Sweetest Name on earth,
How can I, a sinner,
Come to know its worth?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh! the sinful sorrow,
Oh! the strangest shame,
That I saw no beauty
In that sacred Name.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Never felt the sweetness!
Never knew the grace,
Never saw the love-pain
In that wounded face!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Never found the mystery
In that simple word—
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
Savior, Lover, Lord.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Now ’tis past and over.
Gone my guilt and shame;
Jesus, Jesus did it,
Glory to His Name!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}I have seen the glory
Of His tender face,
I have felt with wonder
Thrills of holy grace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Wonderful compassion,
Reaching even me;
Bows my humbled spirit
In captivity.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!
Loved me in my shame.
Oh! the joy and rapture
Of that sacred Name.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
