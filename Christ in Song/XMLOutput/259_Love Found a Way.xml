Love found a way that could make me whole;
Love sent my Lord to the cross of shame,
Love found a way, O praise His holy name!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Wonderful love that rescued me,
Sunk deep in sin,
Guilty and vile as I could be
No hope within;
When ev'ry ray of light had fled,
O glorious day!
Raising my soul from out the dead,
Love found a way.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Love bro't my Saviour here to die
On Calvary,
For such a sinful wretch as I,
How can it be?
Love bridged the gulf 'twixt me and Heav'n,
Taught me to pray;
I am redeemed, set free, forgiv'n,
Love found a way.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Love opened wide the gates of light
To Heav'n's domain,
Where in eternal pow'r and might
Jesus shall reign;
Love lifted me from depths of woe
To endless day,
There was no help in earth below,
Love found a way.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
