Riches none may count or tell
Hath a deep eternal pleasure
Christ the Son he loveth well
God hath here on earth a treasure
None but He its price may know
Deep unfathomable pleasure
Christ revealed in saints below{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Christ the Light that fills the heavens
Shining forth on earth beneath
Through His Spirit freely given
Light of life 'midst shades of death
Down from heaven's unclouded glory
God Himself the treasure brought
Closing thus His love's sweet story
With His sweetest deepest thought{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}God in tongues of fire descending
Chosen vessels thus to fill
With the treasure never ending
Ever spent unfailing still
Still unwasted undiminished
Though the days of dearth wear on
Store eternally unfinished
Fresh as if but now begun{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Earthen vessels marred unsightly
But the treasure as of old
Fresh from glory gleaming brightly
Heaven's undimmed unchanging gold
Gods own hand the vessel filling
From the glory far above
Longing hearts forever stilling
With those riches of His love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Thus through earthen vessels only
Shining forth in ceaseless grace
Reaching weary hearts and lonely
Beams the light in Jesus' face
Vessels worthless broken bearing
Through the hungry ages on
Riches given with hand unsparing
God's great gift - His precious Son{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Thus though worn and tried and tempted
Glorious calling saint is thine
Let the Lord but find thee emptied
Living branch in Christ the vine
Vessels of the world's despising
Vessels weak and poor and base
Bearing wealth God's heart is prizing
Glory from Christ's blessed face{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh to be but emptier lowlier
Mean unnoticed and unknown
And to God a vessel holier
Filled with Christ and Christ alone
Naught of earth to cloud the glory
Naught of self the light to dim
Telling forth His wondrous story
Emptied to be filled with Him{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
