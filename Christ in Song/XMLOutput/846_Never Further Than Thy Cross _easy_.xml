Never higher than thy feet
Here earth's precious things seem dross
Here earth's bitter things grow sweet{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Gazing thus our sin we see
Learn thy love while gazing thus
Sin which laid the Cross on Thee
Love which bore the Cross for us{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Here we learn to serve and give
And rejoicing self deny
Here we gather love to live
Here we gather faith to die{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Symbols of our liberty
And our service here unite
Captives by Thy Cross set free
Soldiers of Thy cross we fight{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Pressing onwards as we can
Still to this our hearts must tend
Where our earliest hopes began
There our last aspirings end{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Till amid the hosts of light
We in thee redeemed complete
Through Thy Cross made pure and white
Cast our crowns before Thy feet{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
