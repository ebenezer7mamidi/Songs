No comeliness I see;
The one thing needful, dearest Lord,
Is to be one with thee.
The sense of thy expiring love,
Into my soul convey;
Thyself bestow, for thee alone,
I absolutely pray.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Whatever else Thy will withholds,
Here grant me to succeed!
O let Thyself my portion be,
And I am blest indeed!
Less than thyself will not suffice
My comfort to restore;
More than thyself I cannot crave,
And thou canst give no more.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Loved of my God, for him again
With love intense I’d burn;
Chosen of thee ere time began,
I choose thee in return.
Whate’er consists not with thy love,
O teach me to resign;
I’m rich to all the intents of bliss,
If thou, O God, art mine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
