Upon the Savior’s brow;
His head with radiant glories crowned,
His lips with grace o’erflow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}No mortal can with Him compare
Among the sons of men;
Fairer is He than all the fair
That fill the heavenly train.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}He saw me plunged in deep distress,
and flew to my relief;
for me He bore the shameful cross,
and carried all my grief.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}To Him I owe my life and breath,
And all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death,
And saves me from the grave.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}To God, the Father, my abode,
He brings my weary feet;
Shows me the glories of my God,
And makes my joys complete.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Since from His bounty I receive
Such proofs of love divine,
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
Lord, they should all be Thine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
