Hope and be undismayed
God hears thy sighs
And counts thy tears
God shall lift up thy head
Through waves and clouds
And storms
He gently clears the way
Wait thou His time
So shall the night
Soon end in joyous day{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Still heavy is thy heart
Still sink thy spirits down
Cast off the weight
Let fear depart
And every care be gone
He everywhere hath sway
And all things serve His might
His every act pure blessing is
His path unsullied light{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Far - Far above thy thought
His counsel shall appear
When fully He the work
Hath wrought
That caused thy needless fear
Leave to His sovereign will
To choose and to command
With wonder filled
Thou then shalt own
How wise
How strong His hand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
