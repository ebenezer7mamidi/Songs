Jesus our King, Jesus our King:
This is our song, who to Jesus belong:
Glory to Jesus, to Jesus our King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Sing we the King who is coming to reign,
Glory to Jesus, the Lamb that was slain;
Righteousness, peace then His empire shall bring,
Joy to the nations when Jesus is King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}All men shall dwell in His marvelous light,
Races long severed His love shall unite,
Justice and truth from His scepter shall spring,
Wrong shall be ended when Jesus is King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}All shall be well in His kingdom of peace,

As the deep waters that cover the sea;

And all harmonious when Jesus is King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Kingdom of Christ, for thy coming we pray,
Hasten, O Father, the dawn of the day
When this new song Thy creation shall sing,
Satan is vanquished and Jesus is King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
