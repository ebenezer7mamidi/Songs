Risen our victorious Head;
Sing His praises; Hallelujah!
Christ is risen from the dead.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Christ is risen! Hallelujah!
Risen our victorious Head;
Sing His praises; Hallelujah!
Christ is risen from the dead.
Gratefully our hearts adore Him,
As His light once more appears;
Bowing down in joy before Him,
Rising up from griefs and tears.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Christ is risen! All the sadness
Of His earthly life is o’er;
Through the open gates of gladness
He returns to life once more;
Death and hell before Him bending,
He doth rise the Victor now,
Angels on His steps attending,
Glory round His wounded brow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Christ is risen! Henceforth never
Death nor hell shall us enthrall;
We are Christ’s, in Him forever
We have triumphed over all;
All the doubting and dejection
Of our trembling hearts have ceased,
’Tis His day of resurrection;
Let us rise and keep the feast.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
