Toiling on (toiling on)
Toiling on (toiling on)
Toiling on (toiling on)
Let us hope (and trust)
Let us watch (and pray)
And labor till the Master comes{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}To the work to the work
We are servants of God
Let us follow the path
That our Master has trod
With the balm of His counsel
Our strength to renew
Let us do with our might
What our hands find to do{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}To the work to the work
Let the hungry be fed
To the fountain of life
Let the weary be led
In the cross and its banner
Our glory shall be
While we herald the tidings
"Salvation is free"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}To the work to the work
There is labor for all
For the kingdom of darkness
And error shall fall
And the name of Jehovah
Exalted shall be
In the loud swelling chorus
"Salvation is free"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}To the work to the work
In the strength of the Lord
And a robe and a crown
Shall our labor reward
When the home of the faithful
Our dwelling shall be
And we shout with the ransomed
"Salvation is free"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
