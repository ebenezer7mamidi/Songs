Sounds aloud from Calvary
See it rends the rocks asunder
Shakes the earth
And veils the sky
It is finished - It is finished
Hear the dying Savior cry{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It is finished - Oh what pleasure
Do these charming words afford
Heavenly blessings
Without measure
Flow to us from Christ the Lord
It is finished - It is finished
Saints the dying words record{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Finished all the types
And shadows
Of the ceremonial law
Finished all that God
Had promised
Death and hell no
More shall awe
It is finished - It is finished
Saints from hence
Your comfort draw{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Tune your harps anew
Ye seraphs
Join to sing the pleasing theme
All on earth and all in heaven
Join to praise Emmanuel's name
Hallelujah - Hallelelujah
Glory to the bleeding Lamb{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
