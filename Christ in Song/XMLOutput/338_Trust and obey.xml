For there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way;
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh or a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief or a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}But we never can prove
The delights of His love,
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do;
Where He sends, we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
