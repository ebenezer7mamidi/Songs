Into this heart of mine
That I to my own self may die
And rise to Thy life divine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Though Christ a thousand times
In Bethlehem be born
If He's not born in thee
Thy soul is still forlorn
The cross on Golgotha
Will never save thy soul
The Cross in thine own heart
Alone can make thee whole{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}What e'er thou lovest man
That too reflect thou must
God if thou lovest God
Dust if thou lovest dust
Let go God will come in
Die thou and let Him live
Be not and He will be
Wait and He'll all things give{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}To bring thee to thy God
Love takes the shortest route
The way which knowledge leads
Is but a roundabout
Drive out from thee the world
And then thy heart shall be
Filled with the love of God
And holy like as He{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
