Through the Holy War
In this sign we conquer
Now and evermore{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Cross of Christ lead onward
Through the Holy War
In this sign we conquer
Now and evermore
Not of man the power
Not to man the fame
We are victors only
In our Leader's name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Not with pomp and pageant
Not in earthly pride
We must fight our battles
Like the crucified
Overcome by suffering
Conquer through defeat
Tried and tested daily
In the furnace heat{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Panoplied in graces
Bold yet humbly meek
Resting while we're working
Strong but ever weak
Timid though couragous
Gaining as we give
Crucified with Jesus
Yet in Him we live{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}By a cloud encompassed
Witnesses above
Saints Apostles Prophets
Precious ones we love
While 'advance' is sounding
Mounts the battle thrill
Cross of Christ lead onward
Where the Captain will{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Marching in the pathway
That the Master trod
Walks One daily with us
Like the Son of God
To the end enduring
Armor ne'er laid down
Til the cross leads upward
To the blood-bought Crown{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
