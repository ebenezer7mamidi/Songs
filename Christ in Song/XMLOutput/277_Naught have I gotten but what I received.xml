Only a sinner saved by grace!
This is my story, to God be the glory,
I’m only a sinner saved by grace!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Naught have I gotten but what I received;
Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed;
Boasting excluded, pride I abase;
I’m only a sinner saved by grace!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart,
Causing my footsteps from God to depart;
Jesus hath found me, happy my case;
I now am a sinner saved by grace!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Tears unavailing, no merit had I;
Mercy had saved me, or else I must die;
Sin had alarmed me, fearing God’s face;
But now I’m a sinner saved by grace!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows,
Loving his Savior to tell what he knows;
Once more to tell it, would I embrace—
I’m only a sinner saved by grace!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
