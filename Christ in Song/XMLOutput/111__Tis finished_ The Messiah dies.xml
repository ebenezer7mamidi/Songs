The Messiah dies,
Cut off for sins, but not His own:
Accomplished is the sacrifice,
The great redeeming work is done.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}’Tis finished! all the debt is paid;
Justice divine is satisfied;
The grand and full atonement made;
God for a guilty world hath died.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The veil is rent in Christ alone;
The living way to Heaven is seen;
The middle wall is broken down,
And all mankind may enter in.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}The types and figures are fulfilled;
Exacted is the legal pain;
The precious promises are sealed;
The spotless Lamb of God is slai{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}The reign of sin and death is o’er,
And all may live from sin set free;
Satan hath lost his mortal power;
’Tis swallowed up in victory.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Saved from the legal curse I am,
My Savior hangs on yonder tree:
See there the meek, expiring Lamb!
’Tis finished! He expires for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Accepted in the Well-beloved,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
I see the bar to heaven removed;
And all Thy merits, Lord, are mine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Death, hell, and sin are now subdued;
All grace is now to sinners given;
And lo, I plead the atoning blood,
And in Thy right I claim Thy Heaven!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
