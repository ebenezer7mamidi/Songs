A spotless Victim dies,
My surety on the tree;
The Lamb of God, the Sacrifice,
He gave Himself for me!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Whatever curse was mine, He bore;
The wormwood and the gall,
There, in that lone mysterious hour,
My cup—He drained it all!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord Jesus! Thou, and none beside,
Its bitterness could know,
Nor other tell Thy joy’s full tide
That from that cup shall flow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Thine is the joy, but yet ‘tis mine.
‘Tis ours as one with Thee;
My joy flows from that grief of Thine;
Thy death brings life to me!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}And while the ages roll along,
This shall my glory be;
And this the new and endless song,
Thy love to us—to me!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
