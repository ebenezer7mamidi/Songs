A secret balm for pain
A beautiful tommorrow
Of sunshine after rain
I've found a branch of healing
Near ev'ry bitter spring
A whispered promise stealing
O'er ev'ry broken string{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I've found a glad hosanna
For every woe and wail
A handful of sweet manna
When grapes from Eshcol fail
I've found a Rock of Ages
When desert wells were dry
And after weary stages
I've found an Elim nigh{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}An Elim with its coolness
Its fountains and its shade
A blessing in its fullness
When buds of promise fade
O'er tears of soft contrition
I've seen a rainbow light
A glory and fruition
So near - Yet out of sight{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}My Savior - Thee possessing
I have the joy the balm
The healing and the blessing
The sunshine and the psalm
The promise for the fearful
The Elim for the faint
The rainbow for the tearful
The glory for the saint{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
