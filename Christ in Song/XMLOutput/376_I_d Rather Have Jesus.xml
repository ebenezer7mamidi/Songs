Or be held in sin's dread sway.
I'd rather have Jesus than anything
This world affords today.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold;
I'd rather be His than have riches untold;
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
I'd rather be led by His nail pierced hand.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause;
I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause;
I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame.
I'd rather be true to His holy name.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;
He's sweeter than honey from out the comb;
He's all that my hungering spirit needs.
I'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
