Worthy the Lamb;
Heav’n throughout with praises ringing,
Worthy the Lamb.
Thrones and pow’rs before Him bending,
Odors sweet with voice ascending
Swell the chorus never ending,
Worthy the Lamb.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Every kindred, tongue and nation,
Worthy the Lamb;
Join to sing the great salvation,
Worthy the Lamb.
Loud as mighty thunders roaring,
Floods of mighty waters pouring,
Prostrate at His feet adoring,
Worthy the Lamb.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Harps and songs forever sounding,
Worthy the Lamb;
Mighty grace o’er sin abounding,
Worthy the Lamb.
By His blood He dearly bought us;
Wand’ring from the fold He sought us,
And to glory safely brought us;
Worthy the Lamb.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Sing with blest anticipation
Worthy the Lamb;
Through the vale of tribulation,
Worthy the Lamb.
Sweetest notes, all notes excelling,
On the theme forever dwelling,
Still untold, though ever telling,
Worthy the Lamb.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
