Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.
O soul, are you weary and troubled,
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Savior
And life more abundant and free.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Through death into life everlasting
He passed and we follow Him there.
Over us sin no more hath dominion
For more than conquerors we are.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}His Word shall not fail you He promised -
Believe Him and all will be well.
Then go to a world that is dying
His perfect salvation to tell.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
