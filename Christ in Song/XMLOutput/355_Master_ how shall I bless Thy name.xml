For love so great to me,
For sweet enablings of Thy grace,
So sovâ€™reign, yet so free,
That taught me to obey Thy word,
And cast my care on Thee?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}No anxious thought upon thy brow
The watching world should see;
No carefulness! O child of God,
For nothing careful be!
But cast thou all thy care on Him
Who always cares for thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}How shall I praise Thee, Savior dear,
For this new life so sweet,
For taking all the care I laid
At Thy beloved feet,
Keeping Thy hand upon my heart
To still each anxious beat?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I long to praise Thee more, and yet
This is no care to me;
If Thou shalt fill my mouth with songs
Then I shall sing to Thee;
And if my silence praise Thee best,
Then silent I will be.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Yet if it be Thy will, dear Lord,
Oh, send me forth to be
Thy messenger to careful hearts,
To bid them taste, and see
How good Thou art to those who cast
All all their care on Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
