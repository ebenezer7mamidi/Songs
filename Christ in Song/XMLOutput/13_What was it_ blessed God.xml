Led Thee to give Thy Son,
To yield Thy Well-beloved
For us by sin undone?

To give Thy Well-beloved for us.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}What led Thy Son, O God,
To leave Thy throne on high,
To shed His precious blood,
To suffer and to die?

Led Him to die and suffer thus.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}What moved Thee to impart

With heavenly peace and love?

For all Thy boundless love to us.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
