I shall know
I shall know Him
And redeemed by His side
I shall stand
I shall know Him
I shall know
I shall know Him
By the print of the nails
In His hands{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}When my lifework is ended
And I cross the swelling tide
When the bright and glorious morning
I shall see
I shall know my Redeemer
When I reach the other side
And His smile will be
The first to welcome me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh the soul-thrilling rapture
When I view His blessed face
And the luster of His kindly beaming eye
How my full heart will praise Him
For the mercy love and grace
That prepare for me
A mansion in the sky{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh the dear ones in glory
How they beckon me to come
And our parting
At the river I recall
To the sweet vales of Eden
They will sing my welcome home
But I long to meet
My Savior first of all{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Through the gates to the city
In a robe of spotless white
He will lead me
Where no tears will ever fall
In the glad song of ages
I shall mingle with delight
But I long to meet
My Savior first of all{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
