We look unto the Son,
In whom Thy heart delighted,
Who all Thy will hath done;
And by the one chief treasure
Thy bosom freely gave,
Thine own pure love we measure,
Thy willing mind to save.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O God of mercy—Father!
The one unchanging claim,
The brightest hopes, we gather
From Christ’s most precious name:
What always sounds so sweetly
In Thine unwearied ear,
Has freed our souls completely
From all our guilt and fear.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The trembling sinner feareth
That God can ne’er forget;
But one full payment cleareth
His memory of all debt.
When nought beside could free us,
Or set our souls at large,
The death of God’s Beloved
Secured a full discharge.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}No wrath God’s heart retaineth
To usward who believe;
No dread in ours remaineth
As we His love receive;
Returning sons He kisses,
And with His robe invests;
His perfect love dismisses
All terror from our breasts.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
