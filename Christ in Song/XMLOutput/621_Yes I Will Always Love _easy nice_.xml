That all the world might hear
Oh love your God alone
And make Christ all your own{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Yes I will always love
And as I ought
Tune to the praise
of love my ceaseless voice
Prefering love
Too vast for human thought
In spite of erring men
Who cavil at my choice{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Why have I not
A thousand thousand hearts
Lord of my soul
That they might all be Thine
If Thou approve
The zeal Thy smile imparts
How should it ever fail
Can such a fire decline{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Love pure and holy
Is a deathless fire
Its object heavenly
It must ever blaze
Eternal love
a God must needs inspire
When once He wins the heart
And fits it for His praise{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Self-love dismissed
'Tis then we live indeed
In her embrace
Death only death is found
Come then one noble effort
And succeed
Cast off the chain of self
With which thy soul is bound{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}O I would cry
That all the world might hear
Ye self-tormentors
Love your God alone
Let His unequalled
Excellence be dear
Dear to your inmost souls
And make Him all your own{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
