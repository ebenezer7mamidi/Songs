Shadowed by sin
Souls are in bondage
Souls we would win
How can we win them
How show the way
"Love never faileth"
Love is the way
"Love never faileth"
Love is the way{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Think how the Master
Came from above
Suffered on Calvary
Breathing out love
Think how He loves us
E'en when we stray
We must love others
Love is His way
We must love others
Love is His way{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}See they are waiting
Looking at you
Silently watching
All that you do
Seeming so careless
Hardened and lost
"Love never faileth"
Count not the cost
"Love never faileth"
Count not the cost{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}"Love never faileth"
Love is pure gold
Love is what Jesus
Came to unfold
Make us more loving
Master we pray
Help us remember
Love is Thy way
Help us remember
Love is Thy way{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
