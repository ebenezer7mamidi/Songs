The Lamb upon His throne;
Hark! how the heavâ€™nly anthem drowns
All music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
Of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Crown Him the Lord of Love:
Behold His hands and side;
Rich wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified:
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends his burning eye
At mysteries so bright.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Crown him the Lord of life,
Who triumphed o'er the grave,
And rose victorious in the strife
For those he came to save;
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high,
Who died eternal life to bring,
And lives that death may die.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Crown Him the Lord of years,
The Potentate of time.
Creator of the rolling spheres,
Ineffably sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise shall never, never fail
Throughout eternity.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Crown Him the Lord of heaven:
One with the Father known,
One with the Spirit through Him given
From yonder glorious throne.
To Thee be endless praise,
For Thou for us hast died;
Be Thou, O Lord, through endless days
Adored and magnified.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
