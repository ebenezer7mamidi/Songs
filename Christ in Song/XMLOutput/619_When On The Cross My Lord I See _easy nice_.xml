Bleeding to death for wretched me
Satan and sin no more can move
For I am all transform'd to love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}His thorns and nails pierce
Through my heart
In every groan I bear a part
I view His wounds with
Streaming eyes
But see
He bows His head and dies{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Come sinners view
The Lamb of God
Wounded and dead
And bathed in blood
Behold His side
And venture near
The well of endless life is here{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Here I forget my cares and pains
I drink yet still my thirst remains
Only the fountain-head above
Can satisfy the thirst of love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh that I thus could always feel
Lord more and more
Thy love reveal
Then my glad tongue
Shall loud proclaim
The grace and glory of Thy name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy name dispels my guilt and fear
Revives my heart
And charms my ear
Affords a balm for every wound
And Satan trembles at the sound{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
