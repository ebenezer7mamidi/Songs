Seeking only Thee to know{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Weaned from all my lordly self

Weaned from all the scorner's ways
Weaned from all the lust of praise{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}All that feeds my busy pride
Cast it evermore aside

Feeling well the peace of God
Flowing from Thy precious blood{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}In this posture let me live
And hosannas daily give
In this temper let me die
And hosannas ever cry{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
