The conflict has begun
Thy battle song triumphant
The victory is won
Hell's power must be vanquished
And Satan's forces strewn
The Captain of the Army
Will come and triumph soon{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Charge soldiers charge in battle
And gaze upon thy Lord
If thou wilt fight His battle
The throne is thy reward
This war is of the spirit
Not fought on earthly ground
The Lord well knows the foe is near
Encircling us around{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Charge soldiers charge in battle
Christ's throne awaiteth thee
His resurrection power
Will lift thy spirit free
Through Him thou wilt have power
The foe to battle down
Through Him thou wilt
The triumph sing
And wear the victor's crown{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Charge soldier charge in battle
Thou shalt ascend the throne
A Feast He is preparing
How happy thou to own
With Him we're resurrected
Above the battle din
Transcending all that binds us
We're far above in Him{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Charge soldiers charge in battle
Thou art the royal heir
The Lord from dust did choose thee
That thou His kingdom share
Thou hast no part in darkness
Thy future O how bright
With Christ to dwell forever
And in His love delight{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}With joyful shouts charge forward
The kindom is before
Upon the peak of Zion
We'll sing the battle o'er
The Lamb has won the victory
The Lamb is on the throne
With shouts of joy we praise Him
For He must over come{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
