His the scepter, His the throne;
Hallelujah! His the triumph,
His the victory alone.
Hark, the songs of His redeemed ones
Thunder like a mighty flood:
Jesus out of every nation
Hath redeemed us by His blood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Hallelujah! not as orphans
Are we left in sorrow now;
Hallelujah! He is near us,
Faith believes, nor questions how.
Though the clouds from sight received Him
When the forty days were o’er,
Shall our hearts forget His promise,
“I am with you evermore“?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Hallelujah! Bread of heaven,
Thou on earth our food, our stay;
Hallelujah! here the hungry
Come to Thee from day to day.
Advocate and Intercessor,
My Redeemer pleads for me,
On the throne of the Almighty
Now and to eternity.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Hallelujah! sing to Jesus,
His the scepter, His the throne;
Hallelujah! His the triumph,
His the victory alone.
Hark, the songs of His redeemed ones
Thunder like a mighty flood:
Jesus out of every nation,
Hath redeemed us by His blood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
