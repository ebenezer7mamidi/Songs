By Thy grace divine
We are on the Lord's side
Saviour we are Thine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Who is on the Lord's side
Who will serve the King
Who will be His helpers
Other lives to bring
Who will leave the world's side
Who will face the foe
Who is on the Lord's side
Who for Him will go{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Not for weight of glory
Not for crown and palm
Enter we the army
Raise the warrior psalm
But for love that claimeth
Lives for whom He died
He whom Jesus nameth
Must be on His side{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus Thou hast bought us
Not with gold or gem
But with Thine own lifeblood
For Thy diadem
With Thy blessing filling
Each who comes to Thee
Thou hast made us willing
Thou hast made us free{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Fierce may be the conflict
Strong may be the foe
But the King's own army
None can overthrow
Round His standard ranging
Victory is secure
For His truth unchanging
Make the triumph sure
Chosen to be soldiers
In an alien land
Chosen called and faithful
For our Captain's band
In the service royal
Let us not grow cold
Let us be right loyal
Noble true and bold{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
