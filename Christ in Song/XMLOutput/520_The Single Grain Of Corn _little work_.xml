So desolate and so forlorn
Lie buried down beneath the ground
Where not a sight and not a sound
Can even for one moment brief
Bring it a vestige of relief{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}And not a single ray of light
Is shed upon its sorry plight
The darkness is so very dense
The lonliness is so intense
And there's no other to explain
Its strange estate to that lone grain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Concealed in such a somber spot
Can it consent to lie and rot
Can it submit to slow decay
Can it let life ebb all away
Can it lie still and simply wait
Till it shall quite disintegrate{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}It can! Hid in its heart there lies
A life that utterly defies
The grave and low beneath the soil
Can wrest from death the richest spoil
Do you behold those many grains
They're fruit of one seed's grievous pains{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
