Waiting for Thy gracious word
Longing for Thy voice that cheereth
Master, let it now be heard
I am listening, Lord, for Thee
What hast Thou to say to me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Often through my heart is pealing
Many another voice than Thine
Many an unwilled echo stealing
From the walls of this Thy shrine
Let Thy longed-for accents fall
Master speak and silence all{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Master, speak, though least and lowest
Let me not unheard depart
Master, speak, for O Thou knowest
All the yearning of my heart
Knowest all its truest need
Speak and make me blest indeed{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Master, speak, and make me ready
When Thy voice is truly heard
With obedience glad and steady
Still to follow every word
I am listening, Lord, for Thee
Master, speak, O speak to me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Speak to me by name, O Master
Let me know it is to me
Speak that I may follow faster
With a step more firm and free
Where the Shepherd leads the flock
In the shadow of the Rock{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
