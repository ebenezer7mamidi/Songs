He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him.
He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I heard an old, old story how a Savior came from glory,
How He gave His life on Calvary to save a wretch like me;
I heard about His groaning, of His precious bloodâ€™s atoning,
Then I repented of my sins and won the victory{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I heard about His healing, of His cleansing power revealing.
How He made the lame to walk again and caused the blind to see;
And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit,"
And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I heard about a mansion He has built for me in glory.
And I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing and the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I'll sing up there the song of victory.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
