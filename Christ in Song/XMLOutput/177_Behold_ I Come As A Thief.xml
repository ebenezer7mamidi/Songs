I Come As A Thief"
Oh, hark to the world of His warning,
He cometh the Star of the Morning
That heralds the light of the Sun;
Far spent in the night of our sorrow,
New comfort, new hope, let us borrow,
For soon on that glorious marrow,
The Great Voice shall say "It is done."
For soon on that glorious morrow,
The Great Voice shall say "It is done."{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}"Behold! I Come As A Thief"
And ere the dull world shall awaken,
The treasure of earth shall be taken,
The salt of the earth and its light;
The dungeons of Death shall be riven
The Bride to the Bridegroom be given
His jewels be ravished to Heaven,
In silent and shadowy night.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}"Behold! I Come As A Thief"
And blessed are they that are watching,
That so their quick ears may be catching.
The sound of His step as they wait;
But woe unto them that are sleeping,
Who, careless, their garments are keeping,
The dawn on their slumbers is creeping-
They waken, but waken too late.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
