O what a word is this!
A sinner reconciled through blood;
This, this indeed is peace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}By nature and by practice far,
How very far from God;
Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him,
Through faith in Jesus’ blood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}So nigh, so very nigh to God,
I cannot nearer be;
For in the person of His Son
I am as near as He.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}So dear, so very dear to God,
More dear I cannot be;
The love wherewith He loves the Son,
Such is His love to me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Why should I ever anxious be,
Since such a God is mine?
He watches o’er me night and day,
And tells me “Mine is thine.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
