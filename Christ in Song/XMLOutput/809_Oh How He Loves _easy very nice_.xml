Oh how He loves
His is love beyond a brothers
Oh how He loves
Earthly friends may fail or leave us
One day soothe the next day grieve us
But this Friend will ne'er deceive us
Oh how He loves{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}'Tis eternal life to know Him
Oh how He loves
Think oh think how much we owe Him
Oh how He loves
With His precious blood He bought us
In the wilderness He sought us
To His fold He safely brought us
Oh how He loves{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Blessed Jesus would you know Him
Oh how He loves

Oh how He loves
Think no longer of the morrow
From the past new courage borrow
Jesus carries all your sorrow
Oh how He loves{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}All your sins shall be forgiven
Oh how He loves
Backward shall your foes be driven
Oh how He loves
Best of blessings He'll provide you
Nought but good shall e'er betide you
Safe to glory He will guide you
Oh how He loves{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
