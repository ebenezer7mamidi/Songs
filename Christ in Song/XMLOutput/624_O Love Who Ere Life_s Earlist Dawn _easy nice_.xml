On me Thy choice hast gently laid
O love who here as man wast born
And wholly like to us wast made
O Love I give myself to Thee
Thine ever only Thine to be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O Love who once in time wast slain
Pierced through and through with bitter woe
O love who wrestling thus didst gain
That we eternal joy might know
O Love I give myself to Thee
Thine ever only Thine to be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O Love of whom is truth and light
The Word and Spirit life and power
Whose heart was bared to them that smite
To shield us in our trial hour
O Love I give myself to Thee
Thine ever only Thine to be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O Love who thus hast bound me fast
Beneath the gentle yoke of Thine
Love who hast conquered me at last
And rapt away this heart of mine
O Love I give myself to Thee
Thine ever only Thine to be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}O Love who lovest me for aye
Who for my soul dost ever plead
O Love who didst my ransom pay
Whose power sufficeth in my stead
O Love I give myself to Thee
Thine ever only thine to be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}O Love who once shalt bid me rise
Form out this dying life of ours
O Love who once o'er yonder skies
Shalt set me in the fadeless bowers
O Love I give myself to Thee
Thine ever only Thine to be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
