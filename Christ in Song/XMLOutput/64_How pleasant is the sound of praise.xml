It well becomes the saints of God;
Should we refuse our songs to raise,
The stones might tell our shame abroad.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}For Him Who washed us in His blood,
Let us our sweetest songs prepare;
He sought us wandering far from God,
And now preserves us by His care.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}One string there is of sweetest tone,
Reserved for sinners saved by grace;
’Tis sacred to one class alone
And touched by one peculiar race.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Though angels may with rapture see
How mercy flows in Jesus’ blood,
It is not theirs to prove, as we,
The cleansing virtue of this flood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Though angels praise the heavenly King,
And worship Him as God alone,
We can with exultation sing,
“He wears our nature on the throne.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord, we adore Thy wondrous love,
Which brought Thee here to bleed and die
That Thou lost sinners may restore
And to the Father bring them nigh.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
