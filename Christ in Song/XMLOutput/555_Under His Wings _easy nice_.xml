Under His wings
Who from His love can sever
Under His wings
My soul shall abide
Safely abide forever{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Under His wings
I am safely abiding
Tho the night deepens
And tempest are wild
Still I can trust Him
I know He will keep me
He has redeemed me
And I am His child{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Under His wings
What a refuge in sorrow
How the heart yearningly
Turns to His rest
Often when earth
Has no balm for my healing
There I find comfort
And there I am blest{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Under His wings
O what precious enjoyment
There will I hide
'Til life's trials are o'er
Sheltered protected
No evil can harm me
Resting in Jesus
I'm safe evermore{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
