Is Jesus Christ her Lord
She is His new creation
By water and the word
From heav'n He came and sought her
To be His holy bride
With His own blood He bought her
And for her life He died{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Elect from ev'ry nation
Yet one o'er all the earth
Her charter of salvation
One Lord one faith one birth
One holy name she blesses
Partakes one holy food
And to one hope she presses
With ev'ry grace endued{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore oppressed
By schisms rent asunder
By heresies distressed
Yet saints their watch are keeping
Their cry goes up how long
And soon the night of weeping
Shall be the morn of song{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}'Mid toil and tribulation
And tumult of her war
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the Church at rest{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Yet she on earth hath union
With God the Three in One
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won
O happy ones and holy
Lord give us grace that we
Like them the meek and lowly
On high may dwell with Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
