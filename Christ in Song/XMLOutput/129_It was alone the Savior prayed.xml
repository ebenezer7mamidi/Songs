He bore it all alone;
He gave Himself to save His own,
He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}It was alone the Savior prayed
In dark Gethsemane;
Alone He drained the bitter cup
And suffered there for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It was alone the Savior stood
In Pilateâ€™s judgment hall;
Alone the crown of thorns He wore,
Forsaken thus by all.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Alone upon the cross He hung
That others He might save;
Forsaken then by God and man.
Alone, His life He gave.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
