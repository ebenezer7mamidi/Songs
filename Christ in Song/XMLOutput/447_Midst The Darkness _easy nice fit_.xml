One bright gleam I see
Well I know the blessed morrow
Christ will come for me
Midst the light and peace and glory
Of the Father's home
Christ for me is waiting watching
Waiting till I come{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Long the blessed Guide has led me
By the desert road
Now I see the golden towers
City of my God
There amidst the love and glory
He is waiting yet
On His hand a name is graven
He can ne'er forget{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Who is this who comes to meet me
On the desert way
As the Morning Star foretelling
God's unclouded day
He it is who came to win me
On the cross of shame
In His glory well I know Him
Evermore the same{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O the blessed joy of meeting
All the desert past
O the wondrous words of greeting
He shall speak at last
He and I together ent'ring
Those bright courts above
He and I together sharing
All the Father's love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Where no shade nor stain can enter
Nor the gold be dim
In the holiness unsullied
I shall walk with Him
Meet companion then for Jesus
From Him for Him made
Glory of God's grace forever
There in me displayed{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}He who in the hour of sorrow
Bore the curse alone
I who through the lonely desert
Trod where He had gone
He and I in that bright glory
One deep joy shall share
Mine to be forever with Him
His that I am there{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
