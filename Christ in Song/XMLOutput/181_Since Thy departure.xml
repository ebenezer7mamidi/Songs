Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
All our desire is Thy promised returning,
Oh, may Thou quickly return.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Since Thy departure from Olivet’s Mountain,
Why is Thy coming again so delayed?
Thru the long years we have longed for Thy coming;
Hast Thou not heard all the prayers that we’ve prayed?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Beloved Lord, since the year Thou ascended
Everything here has been tasteless and dry;
Often in praying and often in watching,
In every movement, for Thee, Lord, we sigh.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Scenes although lovely, yet when will we meet Thee?
Birds and the flowers fair beauty embrace;
All are delightsome, but none satisfy me,
For I am longing for Thy loving face.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord, we’re impatient awaiting Thy coming,
We do not know how much longer ‘twill be;
From every sunrise to every bright sunset
Hope we each moment Thy coming to see.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Whene’er ‘tis raining, or strong winds are blowing,
Whene’er the moon shines, or rises the sea,
We ever hope to discover Thy coming;
How disappointed when no sign of Thee!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}If it were not for the bidding Thou gav’st us,
We’d be discouraged, Thy service we’d shirk;
But Thou dost want us while waiting Thy coming,
For Thee to live and in diligence work.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh Lord, remember the days have been lengthened
Since Thou hast promised ere going away;
We hope and hope and are endlessly hoping,
That Thou wilt come. Canst Thou come e’en today?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
