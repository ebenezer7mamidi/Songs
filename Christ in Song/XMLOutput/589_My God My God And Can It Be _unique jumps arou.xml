And can it be
That I should sin
So lightly now
And think no more
Of evil thoughts
Than of the wind
That waves the bough{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I sin and heav'n
And earth go round
As if no dreadful
Deed were done
As if Thy blood
Had never flowed
To hinder sin
Or to atone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Shall it be always
Thus O Lord
Wilt Thou not work
This hour in me
The grace
Thy passion merited
Hatred of self
And love of Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh by the pains
Of Thy pure love
Grant me the gift
Of holy fear
And by Thy woes
And bloody sweat
Oh wash my guilty
Conscience clear{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Ever when tempted
Make me see
Beneath the olives'
Moon-pierced shade
My God alone
Outstretched and bruised
And bleeding on
The earth He made{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}And make me feel
It was my sin
As though no other
Sins there were
That was to Him
Who bears the world
A load that He
Could scarcely bear{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
