I'll go and not repine
Or climb the mountain rough and steep
Thy will dear Lord not mine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}If I must feel the sharpened knife
For pruning back the vine
If this will bring new shoots of life
Thy will dear Lord not mine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Or maybe take the lower seat
If this is Thy design
And watch my friends with honor meet
Thy will dear Lord not mine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}If for a season I am cast
Like gold to be refined
Into the oven's fiery blast
Thy will dear Lord not mine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Or crushed by sorrow's piercing dart
As grapes are crushed for wine
If this brings sweetness to Thy heart
Thy will dear Lord not mine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}It's in the night time not at day
The stars in beauty shine
The darkness forms the milky way
Thy will dear Lord not mine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}So come what may I will not stray
But to Thy plan resign
I still will walk the narrow way
Thy will dear Lord not mine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
