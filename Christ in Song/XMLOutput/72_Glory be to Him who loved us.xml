Washed us from each sinful stain;

Priests and kings with Him to reign;
Glory, worship, laud and blessing
To the Lamb who once was slain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Glory, worship, laud and blessing,
Thus the choir triumphant sings;

Thus its praise creation brings;

Lord of lords, and King of kings.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Glory to the King of angels,
Glory to the Churchâ€™s King,
Glory to the King of nations,
