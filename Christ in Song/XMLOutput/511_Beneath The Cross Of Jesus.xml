I fain would take My stand
The shadow of A mighty rock
Within a weary land{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}A home within the Wilderness
A rest upon the way
From the burning of The noontide heat
And the burden of the day
Oh, safe and happy Shelter
Oh, refuge tried And sweet
Oh, trysting place where Heaven's love
And heaven's justice meet
As to the holy patriarch
That wondrous dream Was given
So seems my Savior's Cross to me
A ladder up to heaven{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There lies beneath Its shadow
But on the farther side
The darkness of An awful grave
That gapes both Deep and wide
And there between us Stands the cross
Two arms outstretched To save
Like watchman set To guard the way
From that eternal grave{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Upon that cross of Jesus
My eyes at times can see
The very dying Form of One
Who suffered there for me
And from my smitten Heart with tears
Two wonders I confess
The wonders of His Glorious love
And my own Worthlessness{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I take O cross thy shadow
For my abiding place
I ask no other sunshine
Than the sunshine Of His face
Content to let the World go by
To know no gain nor loss
My sinful self my Only shame
My glory all the cross{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
