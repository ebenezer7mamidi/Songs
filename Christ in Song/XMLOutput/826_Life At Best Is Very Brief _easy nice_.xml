Be in time
Be in time
Be in time
While the voice of Jesus calls you
Be in time
Be in time
If in sin you longer wait
You may find no open gate
And your cry be just too late
Be in time{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Life at best is very brief
Like the falling of a leaf
Like the binding of a sheaf
Be in time
Fleeting days are telling fast
That the die will soon be cast
And the fatal line be passed
Be in time{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Fairest flowers soon decay
Youth and beauty pass away
O you have not long to stay
Be in time
While God's Spirit bids you come
Sinner do not longer roam
Lest you seal your hopeless doom
Be in time{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Time is gliding swiftly by
Death and judgement draweth nigh
To the arms of Jesus fly
Be in time
O I pray you count the cost
Ere the fatal line be crossed
And your soul in hell be lost
Be in time{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Sinner heed the warning voice
Make the Lord your final choice
Then all heaven will rejoice
Be in time
Come from darkness into light
Come let Jesus make you right
Come and start for heaven tonight
Be in time{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
