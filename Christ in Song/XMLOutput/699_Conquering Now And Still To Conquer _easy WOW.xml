Not to the swift is the race
Yet to the true and the faithful
Vict'ry is promised through grace{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Conquering now and still to conquer
Rideth a King in His might
Leading the host of all the faithful
Into the midst of the fight
See them with courage advancing
Clad in their brilliant array
Shouting the name of their Leader
Hear them exultingly say{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Conquering now and still to conquer
Who is this wonderful King
Whence all the armies which He leadeth
While of His glory they sing
He is our Lord and Redeemer
Savior and Monarch Divine
They are the stars that forever
Bright in His Kingdom will shine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Conquering now and still to conquer
Jesus Thou Ruler of all
Thrones and their scepters all shall perish
Crowns and their splendor shall fall
Yet shall the armies Thou leadest
Faithul and true to the last
Find in Thy mansions eternal
Rest when their warfare is past{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
