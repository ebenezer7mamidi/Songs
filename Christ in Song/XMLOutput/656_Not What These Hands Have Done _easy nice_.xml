Can save my guilty soul
Not what this toiling flesh has borne
Can make my spirit whole
Not what I feel or do
Can give me peace with God
Not all my prayers and sighs and tears
Can bear my awful load{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy work alone O Christ
Can ease this weight of sin
Thy blood alone O Lamb of God
Can give me peace within
Thy love to me O God
Not mine O Lord to Thee
Can rid me of this dark unrest
And set my spirit free{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy grace alone O God
To me can pardon speak
Thy pow'r alone O Son of God
Can this sore bondage break
No other work save Thine
No other blood will do
No strength save that which is divine
Can bear me safely through{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I bless the Christ of God
I rest on love divine
And with unfalt'ring lip and heart
I call this Savior mine
His cross dispels each doubt
I bury in His tomb
Each thought of unbelief and fear
Each ling'ring shade of gloom{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I praise the God of grace
I trust His truth and might
He calls me His I call Him mine
My God my joy my light
'Tis He who saveth me
And freely pardon gives
I love because He loveth me
I live because He lives{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
