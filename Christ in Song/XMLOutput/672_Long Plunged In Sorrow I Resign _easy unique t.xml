My soul to that dear hand of Thine
Without reserve or fear
That hand shall wipe my streaming eyes
Or into smiles of glad surprise
Transform the falling tear{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}My sole possession is Thy love
In earth beneath or heaven above
I have no other store
And though with fervent suit I pray
And importune thee night and day
I ask Thee nothing more{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The Cross - O ravishment and bliss
How grateful e'en its anguish is
Its bitterness how sweet
There every sense and all the mind
In all her faculties refined
Taste happiness complete{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Self-love no grace in sorrow sees
Consults her own peculiar ease
'Tis all the bliss she knows
But nobler aims true love employ
In self-denial is her joy
In suffering her repose{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Sorrow and love go side by side
Nor height nor depth can e'er divide
Their heaven-appointed bands
Those dear associates still are one
Nor till the race of life is run
Disjoin their wedded hands{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy choice and mine shall be the same
Inspirer of that holy flame
Which must forever blaze
To take the cross and follow Thee
Where love and duty lead shall be
My portion and my praise{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
