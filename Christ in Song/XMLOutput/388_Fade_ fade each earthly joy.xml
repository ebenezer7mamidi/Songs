Jesus is mine.
Break every tender tie;
Jesus is mine.
Dark is the wilderness,
Earth has no resting place,
Jesus alone can bless;
Jesus is mine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Tempt not my soul away;
Jesus is mine.
Here would I ever stay;
Jesus is mine.
Perishing things of clay,
Born but for one brief day,
Pass from my heart away;
Jesus is mine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Farewell, ye dreams of night;
Jesus is mine.
Lost in this dawning bright;
Jesus is mine.
All that my soul has tried
Left but a dismal void;
Jesus has satisfied;
Jesus is mine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Farewell, mortality;
Jesus is mine.
Welcome, eternity;
Jesus is mine.
Welcome, O Loved and Blest,
Welcome, sweet scenes of rest,
Welcome, my Saviorâ€™s breast;
Jesus is mine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
