Yes indeed
Finished ev'ry jot
Sinner this is all you need
Tell me is it not{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Nothing either great or small
Nothing sinner no
Jesus did it did it all
Long long ago{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When He from His lofty throne
Stooped to do and die
Ev'ry thing was fully done
Listen to His cry{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Weary working burdened one
Why do you toil so
Cease your doing all was done
Long long ago{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Till to Jesus' work you cling
By a simple faith
Doing is a deadly thing
Doing ends in death
Cast your deadly doing down
Down at Jesus' feet
Stand in Him in Him alone
Gloriously complete{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
