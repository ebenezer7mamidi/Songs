And dangers affright
Tho' friends should all fail
And foes all unite
Yet one thing secures us
What ever betide
The Scripture assures us
The Lord will provide{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The birds without barn
Or storehouse are fed
From them let us learn
To trust for our bread
His saints what is fitting
Shall ne'er be denied
So long as 'tis written
The Lord will provide{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}His call we obey
Like Abra'm of old
No knowing our way
But faith makes us bold
For though we are strangers
We have a good guide
And trust in all dangers
The Lord will provide{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}When Satan appears
To stop up our path
And fills us with fears
We triumph by faith
He cannot take from us
Though oft he has tried
The heart-cheeting promise
The Lord will provide{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}He tells us we're weak
Our hope is in vain
The good that we seek
We ne'er shall obtain
But when such suggestions
Our spirits have plied
This answers all questions
The Lord will provide{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}No strength of our own
Nor goodness we claim
Yet since we have known
The Savior's dear name
In this our strong tower
For safety we hide the
Lord is our power
The Lord will provide{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}When life sinks apace
And death is in view
The word of His grace
Shall comfort us through
No fearing or doubting
With Christ on our side
We hope to die shouting
The Lord will provide{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
