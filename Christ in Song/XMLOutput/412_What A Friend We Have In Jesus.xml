All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer
O what peace we often forfeit
O what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Ev'rything to God in prayer{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Have we trials and temptations
Is there trouble anywhere
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share
Jesus knows our ev'ry weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Are we weak and heavy laden
Cumbered with a load of care
Precious Savior still our refuge
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Do thy friends despise forsake thee
Take it to the Lord in prayer
In His arms He'll take and shield thee
Thou wilt find a solace there{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
