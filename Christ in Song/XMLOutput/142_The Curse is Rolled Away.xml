The grave has lost her prey!
Dost see that noble throng
Singing a triumph song?
Dost hear the words they sing?
"O death, where is thy sting? Where, grave, thy victory?"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The saints in glad array are praising God always,
For death has been destroyed,
'Tis rendred null and void.
With joyful voice they sing:
"O death, where is thy sting? Where, grave, thy victory?"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O Marvellous display of Life's reality,
That it could swallow up
Death's dark and bitter cup.
Dost hear the whole Church sing?
"O death, where is thy sting? Where, grave, thy victory?"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
