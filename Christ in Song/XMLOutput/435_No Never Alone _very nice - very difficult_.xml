He promised never to leave me
Never to leave me alone
No never alone - No never alone
He promised never to leave me
Never to leave me alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I've seen the lightning flashing
And heard the thunder roll
I've felt sin's breakers clashing
Trying to conquer my soul
I've heard the Voice of Jesus
Telling me still to fight on
He promised never to leave me
Never to leave me alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The world's fierce winds are blowing
Temptations are sharp and keen
I feel a peace in knowing
My Savior stands between
He stands to shield me from danger
When earthly friends are gone
He promised never to leave me
Never to leave me alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When in affliction's valley
I'm treading the road of care
My Savior helps me to carry
My cross when heavy to bear
My feet entangled with briars
Ready to cast me down
My Savior whispered His promise
Never to leave me alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}He died for me on the mountain
For me they pierced His Side
For me He opened the fountain
The crimson cleansing tide
For me He's waiting in glory
Seated upon the throne
He promised never to leave me
Never to leave me alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
