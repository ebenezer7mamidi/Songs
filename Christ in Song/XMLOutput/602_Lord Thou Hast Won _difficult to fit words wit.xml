My heart by mighty grace compelled
Surrenders all to Thee
Against Thy terrors long I strove
But who can stand against Thy love
Love conquers even me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}If Thou hadst bid Thy thunders roll
And light'nings flash to blast my soul
I still had stubborn been
But mercy has my heart subdued
A bleeding Savior I have viewed
And now I hate my sin{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Now Lord I would be Thine alone
Come take possesion of Thine own
For Thou hast set me free
Released from Satan's hard command
See all my powers waiting stand
To be employed by Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
