When conscious of thy sin,
Its heavy weight upon thee,
Its mighty pow’r within:
Then is the hour for pleading
His finished work for thee:
Then is the time for singing,
His blood was shed for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
When tempted to transgress,
By word or look of anger,
Or thought of bitterness:
Then is the hour for claiming
Thy Lord to fight for thee:
Then is the time for singing,
He doth deliver me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
When daily cares perplex,
And trifles seem so mighty
Thy inner soul to vex:
Then is the hour for grasping
His hand who walked the sea:
Then is the time for singing
He makes it calm for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
When thou art wearied sore,
When head or hand refuses
To think or labor more:
Then is the hour for leaning
Upon the Master’s breast:
Then is the time for singing,
My Savior gives me rest.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}O trust thyself to Jesus,
When thou art full of care,
For loved ones still refusing
Our blessed hope to share.
Then is the hour for trusting
Thy Lord to bring them nigh ;
Then is the time for singing,
He loves them more than I.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
