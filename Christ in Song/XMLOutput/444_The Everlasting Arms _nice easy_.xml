Are the everlasting arms
Everlasting - Everlasting
Are the everlasting arms{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Art thou sunk in depths of sorrow
Where no arm can reach so low
There is One whose arms almighty
Reach beyond thy deepest woe
God th'Eternal is thy refuge
Let it still - thy wild alarms
Underneath thy deepest sorrow
Are the everlasting arms{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Other arms grow faint and weary
These can never faint nor fail
Others reach our mounts of blessing
These our lowest loneliest vale
O that all might know His friendship
O that all might see His charms
O that all might have beneath them
Jesus' everlasting arms{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Underneath us O how easy
We have not to mount on high
But to sink into His fullness
And in trustful weakness lie
And we find our humbling failures
Save us from the strength that harms
We may fail but underneath us
Are the everlasting arms{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Arms of Jesus fold me closer
To Thy strong and loving breast
Till my spirit on Thy bosom
Finds its everlasting rest
And when time's last sands are sinking
Shield my heart from all alarms
Softly whisp'ring
Underneath thee are the everlasting arms{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
