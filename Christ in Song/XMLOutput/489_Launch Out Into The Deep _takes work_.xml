(Oh Launch out) (in the deep)
Oh let the shoreline go
Launch out - Launch out - in the ocean divine
Out where the full tides flow{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}The mercy of God is an ocean divine
A boundless and fathomless flood
Launch out in the deep
Cut away the shoreline
And be lost in the fullness of God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}But many alas
Only stand on the shore
And gaze on the ocean so wide
They never have ventured
Its depths to explore
Or to launch on the fathomless tide{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}And others just venture
away from the land
And linger so near to the shore
That the surf and the slime
That beat o'er the strand
Dash o'er them in floods evermore{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh let us launch out
on this ocean so broad
Where the floods of salvation e'er flow
Oh let us be lost
in the mercy of God
Till the depths
of His fullness we know{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
