How shall I copy Him I love
Nor from those blessed
Footsteps swerve
Which lead me to His seat above{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Privations sorrows bitter scorn
The life of toil the mean abode
The faithless kiss the crown of thorn
Are these the consecrated road{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord should my path
Through suff'ring lie
Forbid it I should e'er repine
Still let me turn to Calvary
Nor heed my griefs
Remembering Thine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O let me think how Thou didst leave
Untasted every pure delight
To fast - to faint - to watch - to grieve
The toilsome day - the homeless night{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}To faint - to grieve - to die for me
Thou camest not Thyself to please
And dear as earthly comforts be
Shall I not love Thee more than these{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Yes I would count them all but loss
To gain the notice of Thine eye
Flesh shrinks and trembles at the cross
But Thou canst give the victory{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
