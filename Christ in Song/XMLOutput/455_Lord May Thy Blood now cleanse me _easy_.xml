From all its misery
I'd henseforth be forever
Completely filled with Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord may Thy blood now cleanse me
Wash all my sins away
That with Thy Holy Spirit
Thou may annoint I pray
My service I confess Lord
Is failurefull and weak
The filling of Thy spirit
To live for Thee I seek{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh Lord how dry my heart is
It yearns and pants for Thee
The filling of Thy Spirit
Is now my fervent plea
Within the smitten Rock Lord
I would entirely hide
Pour through Thy living water
Till I am satisfied{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}How cold my heart has been Lord
How slow obeying Thee
So fill me with Thy Spirit
I'll ne'er rebellious be
I lie upon Thy altar
And dare not move away
Oh may Thy flame descending
Consume my all I pray{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh may Thy Cross within me
Deepen its work and burn
In me enlarge Thy measure
And me to ashes turn
Oh may Thy Spirit fill me
Each day more than before
And may Thy living water
On me and through me pour{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
