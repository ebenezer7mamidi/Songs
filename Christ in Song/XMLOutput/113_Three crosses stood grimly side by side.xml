On the hill of Calvary;
On each a suffering man had died;
Two for their crimes, the other for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Like a lamb they led Him out to die
From shades of Gethsemane;
He uttered no moan, no bitter cry;
'Twas love that moved Him to die for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}On the central cross they nailed my Friend,
To languish in agony;
He bore it all to the bitter end â€”
O wonderful love, He died for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}"If Thou art the Christ," they taunting, said,
"Come down from the cursed tree;"
He heeded no jeering word they said.
But, bowing His head. He died for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Like a wandering sheep I had gone astray,
But all my iniquity
My God laid on Him that awful day,
When, bearing my sins, He died for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, thanks for the love that brought Him down.
Love, fathomless, like the sea;
His brow was pierced by a thorny crown.
That a crown of life might be given me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}My brother, behold Him, crucified,
On the cross of Calvary;
Thy ransom see in that crimson tide;
Oh freely it flowed for you and me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
