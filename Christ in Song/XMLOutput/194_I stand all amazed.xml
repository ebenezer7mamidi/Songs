Enough to die for me!
O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,
Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;
I tremble to know that for me He was crucified,
That for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled and died.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I marvel that He would descend from His throne divine
To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;
That He should extend His great love unto such as I,
Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I think of His side, pierced and bleeding to pay the debt,
Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?
No, no! I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,
And testify all my desires He doth fully meet.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
