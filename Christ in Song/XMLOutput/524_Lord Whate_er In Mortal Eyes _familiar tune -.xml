My conscious soul appear
Seen beneath that fair disguise
Which veils the most sincere
Thou dost with all piercing view
Search my inmost spirit through{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}In my native vileness seen
Ere Grace subdued my will
All the sinner might have been
All that makes me still
Sigh or tremble doubt or moan
Known to Thee and Thee alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In abasment at Thy feet
Lord I would ever lie
Yet it is a Mercy-seat
And I may venture nigh
Who the contrite shall condemn
Christ hath died and pleads for them{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Let me still in human sight
A holy semblance wear
What but Mercy Infinite
Could perfect knowledge bear
He who fashioned knows my frame
And Forgiveness is His name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}But if Thine approving smile
My Father cheer my breast
Let the world account me vile
It shall not break my rest
Strong in weakness I shall be
Rich however poor in Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
