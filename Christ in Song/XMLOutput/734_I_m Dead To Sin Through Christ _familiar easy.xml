Through Christ my Lord
For in His death
I also died
It's written clear
In God's own Word
And praise His name
I'm justified{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I'm dead to sin
Thus I must live
To Christ alone
Who gave His all
And for His love
I can't but give
My life and gifts
Both great and small{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I'm dead to sin
So I must serve
My God and King
Each day and hour
What He commands
I must observe
And seek to do
With heav'nly pow'r{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I'm dead to sin
O blessed thought
I now can rest from
Care and strife
My fight He has
Forever fought
And now I live
His risen life{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
