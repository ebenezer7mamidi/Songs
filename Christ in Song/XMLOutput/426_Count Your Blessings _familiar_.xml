Name them one by one
Count your blessings
See what God hath done
Count your blessings
Name them one by one
And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}When upon life's billows
You are tempest tossed
When you are discouraged
Thinking all is lost
Count your many blessings
Name them one by one
And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Are you ever burdened
With a load of care
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear
Count your many blessings
Every doubt will fly
And you will be singing
As the days go by{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When you look at others
With their lands and gold
Think that Christ has promised
You His wealth untold
Count your many blessings
Money cannot buy
Your reward in heaven
Nor your home on high{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}So amid the conflict
Whether great or small
Do not be discouraged
God is over all
Count your many blessings
Angels will attend
Help and comfort give you
To your journey's end{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
