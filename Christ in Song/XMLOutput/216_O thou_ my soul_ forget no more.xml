The friend who all thy misery bore;
Let every idol be forgot,
But, O my soul, forget Him not.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus for thou a body takes,
Thy guilt assumes, thy fetters breaks,
Discharging all thy dreadful debt;
And canst thou eâ€™er such love forget?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Renounce thy works and ways, with grief,
And fly to this most sure relief;
Nor Him forget, who left His throne,
And for thy life gave up His own.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Eternal truth and mercy shine,
In Him, and He Himself is thine:
And canst thou, then, with sin beset,
Such charms, such matchless charms, forget?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
