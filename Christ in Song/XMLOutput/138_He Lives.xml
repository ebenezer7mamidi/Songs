He walks with me and talks with me along life’s narrow way.
He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!
You ask me how I know He lives?
He lives within my heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I serve a risen Savior
He’s in the world today.
I know that He is living,
Whatever men may say.
I see His hand of mercy;
I hear His voice of cheer;
And just the time I need Him
He’s always near.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}In all the world around me
I see His loving care,
And though my heart grows weary,
I never will despair;
I know that He is leading,
Through all the stormy blast;
The day of His appearing
Will come at last.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian,
Lift up your voice and sing
Eternal hallelujahs
To Jesus Christ the King!
The Hope of all who seek Him,
The Help of all who find,
None other is so loving,
So good and kind.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
