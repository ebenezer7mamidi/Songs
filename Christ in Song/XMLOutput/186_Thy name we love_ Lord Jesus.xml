And lowly bow before Thee;
And while we live, to Thee we give
All blessing, worship, glory.
We sing aloud Thy praises,
Our hearts and voices blending,
’Tis Thou alone we worthy own,
Thy beauty’s all-transcending.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy name we love, Lord Jesus;
It tells God’s love unbounded
To ruined man, ere time began,
Or heav’n and earth were founded:
Thine is a love eternal,
That found in us its pleasure,
That brought Thee low to bear our woe
And make us Thine own treasure.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy name we love, Lord Jesus;
It tells Thy birth so lowly,
Thy patience, grace, and gentleness,
Thy lonely path, so holy;
Thou wast the “Man of Sorrows”;
Our grief, too, Thou didst bear it;
Our bitter cup Thou drankest up;
The thorny crown, didst wear it.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy name we love, Lord Jesus;
God’s Lamb—Thou wast ordained,
To bear our sins (Thyself all clean)
And hast our guilt sustained.
We see Thee crowned in glory,
Above the heavens now seated,
The vict’ry won, Thy work well done,
Our righteousness completed.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
