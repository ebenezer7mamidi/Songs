My great Redeemer’s praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad,
The honors of Thy name.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;
’Tis music in the sinner’s ears,
’Tis life, and health, and peace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}His love my heart has captive made,
His captive would I be,
For He was bound, and scourged and died,
My captive soul to free.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}See all your sins on Jesus laid:
The Lamb of God was slain,
His soul was once an offering made
For every soul of man.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,
your loosened tongues employ;
ye blind, behold your savior come,
and leap, ye lame, for joy.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}He breaks the power of canceled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean;
His blood availed for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}So now Thy blessed Name I love,
Thy will would e’er be mine.
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
My Lord, they all were Thine!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
