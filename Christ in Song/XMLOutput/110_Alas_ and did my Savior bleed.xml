I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Alas, and did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Was it for sins that I had done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut His glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man, His creature’s sin.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears.
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
And melt mine eyes to tears.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}But drops of grief can ne’er repay
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
’Tis all that I can do.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
