Who gave for us His well-beloved Son,
The gift of gifts, all other gifts in one;
Blessed be God, our God!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}What will He not bestow!
Who freely gave this mighty gift unbought,
Unmerited, unheeded, and unsought,
What will He not bestow?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}He spared not His Son!
’Tis this that silences each rising fear,
’Tis this that bids the hard thought disappear;
He spared not His Son!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Who shall condemn us now?
Since Christ has died, and ris’n, and gone above,
For us to plead at the right hand of Love;
Who shall condemn us now?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}’Tis God that justifies!
Who shall recall His pardon or His grace?
Or who the broken chain of guilt replace?
’Tis God that justifies!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}The victory is ours!
For us in might came forth the mighty One;
For us He fought the fight, the triumph won:
The victory is ours!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
