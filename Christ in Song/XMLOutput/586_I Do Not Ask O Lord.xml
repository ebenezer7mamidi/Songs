O Lord that life may be
A pleasant road
I do not ask
That thou wouldst take from me
Aught of its load{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I do not ask
That flowers should always spring
Beneath my feet
I know too well
The poison and the sting
Of things too sweet{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}For one thing only
Lord dear Lord I plead
Lead me aright
Though strength should falter
And though heart should bleed
Through peace to light{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I do not ask O Lord
That Thou shouldst shed
Full radiance here
Give but a ray of peace
That I may tread
Without a fear{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I do not ask my
Cross to understand
My way to see
Better in darkness
Just to feel Thy hand
And follow Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Joy is like restless day
But peace divine
Like quiet night
Lead me O Lord
Till perfect day shall shine
Through peace to light{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
