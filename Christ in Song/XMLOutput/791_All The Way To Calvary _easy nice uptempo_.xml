He went for me
He went for me
He went for me
All the way to Calvary
He went for me
He died to set me free{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh how dark the night that wrapt my spirit round
Oh how deep the woe my Savior found
When He walk'd across the waters of my soul
Bade my night disperse and made me whole{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Trembling a sinner bow'd before His face
Naught I knew of pardon God's free grace
Heard a voice so melting

Jesus bought thy pardon paid thy debt"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O 'twas wondrous love the Savior show'd for me
When He left His throne for Calvary
When He bore my trespass bore it all alone
Praise His Name forever make it known{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
