'Tis shining for thee
Sweetly the light
Has dawned upon me
Once I was blind
But now I can see
The Light of the world
Is Jesus{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}The whole world was lost
In the darkness of sin

The Light of the world is Jesus{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}No darkness have we

We walk in the Light
When we follow our Guide
The Light of the world is Jesus{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}No need of the sunlight
In Heaven we're told

In the city of gold
