Our wak'ning and uprising prove
Thru sleep and darkness safely brought
Restored to life and pow'r and thought{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}New mercies each returning day
Hover around us while we pray
New perils past new sins forgiv'n
New thoughts of God
New hopes of heav'n{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}If on our daily course our mind
Be set to hallow all we find
New treasures still of countless price
God will provide for sacrifice{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Old friends old scenes will lovelier be
As more of heav'n in each we see
Some soft'ing gleam of love and prayer
Shall dawn on every cross and care{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}The trivial round the common task
Will furnish all we ought to ask
Room to deny ourselves a road
To bring us daily nearer God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Only O Lord in Thy dear love
Fit us for perfect rest above
And help us this and every day
To live more nearly as we pray{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
