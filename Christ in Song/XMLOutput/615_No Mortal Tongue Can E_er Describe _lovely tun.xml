The freedom of the soul
When passed beyond all earthly bribe
To God's complete control
All things are his yes life and death
Things present or to come
In Christ he draws in peace each breath
In Christ he finds his home{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When such as we the King can choose
To share with Him His throne
'Tis passing strange that we refuse
To be our Lord's alone
O never speak of sacrifice
A privilege untold
Is to be His at any price
In Calv'ry's hosts enrolled{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Arise the holy bargain strike
The fragment for the whole
All men and all events alike
Must serve the ransomed soul
All things are yours when you are His
And He and you are one
A boundless life in Him there is
Whence doubt and fear are gone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
