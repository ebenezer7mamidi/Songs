Were my life worth living for a day
Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort
In the things that soon must pass away
If I gained the world but lost the Savior
Would my gain be worth the life-long strife
Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing
For a moment with a Christ-filled life{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Had I wealth and love in fullest measure
And a name revered both far and near
Yet no hope beyond no harbor waiting
Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer
If I gained the world but lost the Savior
Who endured the cross and died for me
Could then all the world afford a refuge
Whither in my anguish I might flee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O what emptiness without the Savior
'Mid the sins and sorrows here below
And eternity how dark without Him
Only night and tears and endless woe
What though I might live without the Savior
When I come to die how would it be
O to face the valley's gloom without Him
And without Him all eternity{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O the joy of having all in Jesus
What a balm the broken heart to heal
Ne'er a sin so great but He'll forgive it
Nor a sorrow that He does not feel
If I have but Jesus only Jesus
Nothing else in all the world beside
O then ev'rything is mine in Jesus
For my needs and more He will provide{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
