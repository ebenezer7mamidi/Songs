On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God!
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}His dying crimson, like a robe,
Spreads o’er His body on the tree;
Then I am dead to all the globe,
And all the globe is dead to me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
