My soul takes delight
On whom in affliction I call
My comfort by day
And my song in the night
My hope my salvation my all{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Where dost Thou dear Shepherd
Resort with Thy sheep
To feed them in pastures of love
Say why in the valley
Of death should I weep
Or alone in this wilderness rove{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O why should I wander
An alien from Thee
Or cry in the desert
For bread
Thy foes will rejoice
When my sorrows they see
And smile at the tears
I have shed{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Restore my Savior
The light of Thy face
Thy soul-cheering comfort impart
And let the sweet tokens
Of pardoning grace
Bring joy to my desolate heart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Ye daughters of Zion declare
Have you seen the star
That on Israel shone
Say if in your tents
My beloved has been
And where with His flocks
He is gone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Dear Shepherd I hear
And will follow Thy call
I know the sweet sound of Thy voice
Restore and defend me
For Thou art my all
And in Thee I will ever rejoice{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
