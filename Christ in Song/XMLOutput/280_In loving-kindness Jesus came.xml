With tender hand He lifted me,
From shades of night to plains of light,
Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}In loving-kindness Jesus came
My soul in mercy to reclaim,
And from the depths of sin and shame
Through grace He lifted me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He called me long before I heard,
Before my sinful heart was stirred,
But when I took Him at His word,
Forgiv’n, He lifted me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}His brow was pierced with many a thorn,
His hands by cruel nails were torn,
When from my guilt and grief, forlorn,
In love He lifted me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Now on a higher plane I dwell,
And with my soul I know ’tis well;
Yet how or why, I cannot tell,
He should have lifted me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
