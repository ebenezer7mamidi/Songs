of him who died upon the cross;
the sinner's hope let men deride,
for this we count the world but loss.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Inscribed upon the cross we see
in shining letters, 'God is love';
he bears our sins upon the tree;
he brings us mercy from above.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The cross! It takes our guilt away:
it holds the fainting spirit up;
it cheers with hope the gloomy day,
and sweetens every bitter cup.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}It makes the coward spirit brave,
and nerves the feeble arm for fight;
it takes its terror from the grave,
and gilds the bed of death with light:{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}The balm of life, the cure of woe,
the measure and the pledge oflove,
the sinner's refuge here below,
the angels' theme in heaven above.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
