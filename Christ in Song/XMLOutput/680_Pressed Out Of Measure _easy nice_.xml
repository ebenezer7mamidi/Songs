And God is my joy
He is the resurrection life I enjoy{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Pressed out of measure
Pressed beyond all length
Pressed so intensely
Seeming beyond strength
Pressed in the body
Pressed within the soul
Pressed in the mind
Till darksome surges roll{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Pressure by foes
And pressure from our friends
Pressure on pressure
Till life nearly ends
Pressed into knowing
None to help but God
Pressed into loving
Both the staff and rod{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Pressed into liberty
Where nothing clings
Pressed into faith
For hard and hopeless things
Pressed into life
A life in Christ the Lord
Pressed into life
The life of Christ outpoured{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
