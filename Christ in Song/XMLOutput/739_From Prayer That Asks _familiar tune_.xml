Sheltered from winds that beat on Thee
From fearing when I should aspire
From falt'ring when I should climb high'r
From silken self O Captain free
Thy soldier who would follow Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}From subtle love of softening things
From easy choices weakenings
Not thus are spirits fortified
Not this way went the Crucified
From all that dims Thy Calvary
O Lamb of God deliver me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Give me the love that leads the way
The faith that nothing can dismay
The hope no disappointments tire
The passion that will burn like fire
Let me not sink to be a clod
Make me Thy fuel O flame of God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
