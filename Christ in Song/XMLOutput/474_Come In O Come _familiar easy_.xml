The door stands open now
I knew Thy voice
Lord Jesus it was Thou
The sun has set long since
The storms begin
'Tis time for Thee
My Savior O Come in{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Alas ill-ordered shows
The dreary room
The household-stuff lies
Heaped amids the gloom
The table empty stands
The couch undressed
Ah what a welcome
for th'Eternal Guest{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Yet welcome and
Tonight this doleful scene
Is e'en itself my cause
To hail Thee in
This dark confusion
E'en at once demands
Thine own bright presence
Lord and ord'ring hands{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I seek no more
To alter things or mend
Before the coming
Of so great a Friend
All were at best
Unseemly and 'twere ill
Beyond all else to keep
Thee waiting still{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Come not to find
But make this troubled heart
A dwelling worthy of
Thee as Thou art
To chase the gloom
The terror and the sin
Come all Thyself
Yes come Lord Jesus in{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
