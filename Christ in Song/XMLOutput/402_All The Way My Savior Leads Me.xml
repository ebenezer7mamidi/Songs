What have I to ask beside
Can I doubt His tender mercy
Who thro' life has been my Guide
Heav'nly peace
Divinest comfort
Here by faith in Him to dwell{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}For I know whate'er befall me
Jesus doeth all things well
For I know whate'er befall me
Jesus doeth all things well
All the way my Savior leads me
Cheers each winding
Path I tread
Gives me grace for every trial
Feeds me with the living bread
Tho' my weary steps may falter
And my soul athirst may be
Gushing from
The Rock before me
Lo a spring of joy I see
Gushing from
The Rock before me
Lo a spring of joy I see{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}All the way my Savior leads me
O the fullness of His love
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father's house above
When my spirit
Clothed immortal
Wings its flight
To realms of day
This my song
Thro' endless ages
Jesus led me all the way
This my song
Thro' endless ages
Jesus led me all the way{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
