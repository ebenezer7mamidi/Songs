Lies too deep
For human ministry
It knows not how
To tell itself
To any but to Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou dost remember
Still amid
The glories of
God's Throne
The sorrows of
Mortality
For they were once
Thine own{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus my fainting
Spirit brings
Its fearfulness to Thee
Thine eye at least
Can penetrate
The clouded mystery{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}And is it not enough
Enough
This holy sympathy
There is no sorrow
e'er so deep
But I may bring to Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
