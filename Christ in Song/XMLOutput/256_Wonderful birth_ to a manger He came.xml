wonderful crown He wears,
wonderful blessings His triumphs afford;

wonderful love of my wonderful Lord!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Wonderful birth, to a manger He came,
made in the likeness of man, to proclaim
God’s boundless love for a world sick with sin,
pleading with sinners to let Him come in.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Wonderful life, full of service so free,

undying faith in the vilest He showed.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Wonderful death, for it meant not defeat,

coming as King o’er the nations to reign;
