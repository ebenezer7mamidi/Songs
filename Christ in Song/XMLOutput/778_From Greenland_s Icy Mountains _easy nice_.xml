From India's coral strand
Where Afric's sunny fountains
Roll down their golden sand
From many an ancient river
From many a palmy plain
They call us to deliver
Their land from error's chain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}What though the spicy breezes
Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle
Though every prospect pleases
And only man is vile
In vain with lavish kindness
The gifts of God are strewn
The heathen in his blindness
Bows down to wood and stone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Can we whose souls are lighted
With wisdom from on high
Can we to man benighted
The lamp of life deny
Salvation O salvation
The joyful sound proclaim
Till earth's remotest nation
Has learned Messiah's name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Waft waft ye winds His story
And you ye waters roll
Till like a sea of glory
It spreads from pole to pole
Till o'er our ransomed nature
The Lamb for sinners slain
Redeemer King Creator
In bliss returns to reign{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
