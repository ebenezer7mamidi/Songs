As Man, for man was made a curse.
The claims of law which He had made,
Unto the uttermost He paid.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}His holy fingers made the bough
Which grew the thorns that crowned His brow.
The nails that pierced His hands were mined
In secret places He designed.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}He made the forest whence there sprung
The tree on which His body hung.
He died upon a cross of wood,
Yet made the hill on which it stood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}The sky that darkened oâ€™er His head
By Him above the earth was spread.
The sun that hid from Him its face
By His decree was poised in space.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}The spear which spilled His precious blood
Was tempered in the fires of God.
The grave in which His form was laid,
Was hewn in rocks His hands had made.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}The throne on which He now appears
Was His from everlasting years.
But a new glory crowns His brow.
And every knee to Him shall bow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
