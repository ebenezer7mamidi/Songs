Be content to bear the shame
Seek no earthy sordid prize
Ye who bear His holy Name
Wait in faith that glorious day
When before the Father's Throne
Jesus will yor name confess
All your tears and labors own{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Be content whate'er your lot
With no settled dwelling here
Be a pilgrim with the Lord
Let Him dry the secret tear
Let Him be your heart's delight
His approval your reward
Till in Heaven's unsullied light
You shall stand with Christ your Lord{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Be content to win your prize
At the cost of tears and blood
Earthly loss or gain despise
Tread the path that Jesus trod
Never take a look behind
Keep the promised crown in view
Thus unmindful of the cost
Thus come glorioulsy through{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
