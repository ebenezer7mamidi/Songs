The heavens He says are His throne
All worlds are His mighty domain
All kingdoms His scepter shall own
He dwells with his people below
He loves in their trials to share
We dwell with the King for his work
His burden we willingly bear{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I'm dwelling with Jesus my King
I've found where He dwells with His own
I've opened the door of my heart
He's made it His temple and throne
Like Mary I sit at His feet
Like John I recline on His breast
His presence is fullness of joy
His bosom is infinite rest{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I dwell with the King for His work
I've part in His glorious plan
To bring in His kindom to earth
And tell His salvation to man
The world has its work and rewards
I count them but folly and loss
My business is only His work
My message is only His cross{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I dwell with the King for His work
The work it is His and not mine
He plans and prepares it for me
And fills me with power divine
So duty is changed to delight
And prayer into praise as I sing
I dwell with my King for His work
And work in the strength of my King{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}We'll dwell with the King for His work
And work through each day of the year
Perhaps ere it passes the King
In glory Himself shall appear
Oh then in some closer embrace
Oh then in some nobler employ
We'll dwell with the King for His work
In endless ineffable joy{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
