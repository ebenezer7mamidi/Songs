The precious herb unbruised no fragrance frees
No wine from grapes without the winepress toil
Must I be bruised and pressed Lord such as these
Lord Thy afflictions are true gain to me
What Thou removest Lord replace with Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}For sacred Love to find the melody
Must my heart's strings be stretched
And tuned by Thee
Must I be smitten Lord to know Thy love
I fear no loss if Thou draw close to me
Lord Thy afflictions are true gain to me
What Thou removest Lord replace with Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh how ashamed I feel for holding back
You sculpted me yet I myself retain
According to thy pleasure dear Lord act
Mind not my feelings Thy delight is gain
Lord Thy afflictions are true gain to me
What Thou removest Lord replace with Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord should my joy and pain
Not match Thine own
I'll welcome - bear Thy yoke at any cost
I'll take the suff'rings for Thy joy alone
If You are pleased I'll gladly bear Thy cross
Lord Thy afflictions are true gain to me
What Thou removest Lord replace with Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I want to praise Thee with the sweetest praise
On earth there is none fairer Lord than Thee
Tears cloud my eyes yet sweetness fills my heart
May I decrease - may Thou increase in me
Lord Thy afflitions are true gain to me
What Thou removest Lord replace with Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
