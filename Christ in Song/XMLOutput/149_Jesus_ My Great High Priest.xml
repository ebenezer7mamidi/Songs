Offered his blood and died;
My guilty conscience seeks
No sacrifice beside.
His pow’rful blood did once atone,
And now it pleads before the Throne.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}To this dear Surety’s hand
Will I commit my cause;
He answers and fulfills
His Father’s broken laws.
Behold my soul at freedom set;
My Surety paid the dreadful debt.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}My Advocate appears
For my defense on high;
The Father bows his ears
And lays his thunder by.
Not all that hell or sin can say
Shall turn his heart, his love, away.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Should all the hosts of death
And pow’rs of hell unknown
Put their most dreadful forms
Of rage and mischief on,
I shall be safe, for Christ displays
His conqu’ring pow’r and guardian grace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
