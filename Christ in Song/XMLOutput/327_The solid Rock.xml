All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus Christ, my righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesusâ€™ name.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When darkness veils His lovely face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
In Him, my righteousness, alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
