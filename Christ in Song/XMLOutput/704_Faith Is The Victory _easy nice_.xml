Faith is the victory
O glorious victory
That overcomes the world{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Encamped along the hills of light
Ye Christian soldiers rise
And press the battle ere the night
Shall veil the glowing skies
Against the foe in vales below
Let all our strength be hurled
Faith is the victory we know
That overcomes the world{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}His banner over us is love
Our sword the Word of God
We tread the road the saints before
With shouts of triumph trod
By faith they like a whirlwind's breath
Swept on o'er every field
The faith by which they conquered death
Is still our shining shield{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}On every hand the foe we find
Drawn up in dread array
Let tents of ease be left behind
And onward to the fray
Salvation's helmet on each head
With truth all girt about
The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread
And echo with our shout{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}To him that overcomes the foe
White raiment shall be giv'n
Before the angels he shall know
His name confessed in heav'n
Then onward from the hills of light
Our hearts with love aflame
We'll vanquish all the hosts of night
In Jesus' conqu'ring name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
