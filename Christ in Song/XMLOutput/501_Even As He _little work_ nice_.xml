(Even as He)
Even as He
(Even as He)
Wonderful words that even we
Saved by His marvelous grace may be
One with the Savior
Even as He{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh what a wonderful place
Jesus has given to me
Saved by His glorious grace
I may be even as He
When with my Lord I appear
Like Him I know I shall be
But while I walk with Him here
I may be even as He{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}One in His death on the tree
One as He rose from the dead
I from the curse am as free
E'en as my glorious Head
One on the throne by His side
One in His sonship divine
One as the Bride-groom and bride
One as the branch and the Vine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}One in His merits I stand
One as I pray in His name
All that His worth can command
I can with confidence claim
One in His faith and His love
One in His life I may be
Sealed by the heavenly Dove
I may be holy as He{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}One in the rapturous hour
When He shall come for His own
Raised by His glorious power
I shall sit down on His throne
All that He has shall be mine
All that He is I shall be
Robed in His glory divine
I shall be even as He{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
