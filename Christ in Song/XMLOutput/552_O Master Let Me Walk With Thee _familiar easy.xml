In lowly paths of service free
Tell me Thy secret
Help me bear
The strain of toil
The fret of care{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Help me the slow of heart
To move
By some clear winning
Word of love
Teach me the wayward
Feet to stay
And guide them
In the homeward way{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Teach me Thy patience
Still with Thee
In closer dearer company
In work that keeps
Faith sweet and strong
In trust that triumphs
Over wrong{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}In hope that sends
A shinning ray
Far down the future's
Broad'ning way
In peace that only
Thou canst give
With Thee
O Master let me live{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
