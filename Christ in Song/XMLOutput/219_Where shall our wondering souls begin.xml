How shall we all to Heaven aspire?
As slaves redeemed from death and sin,
As brands plucked from eternal fire,
How shall we equal triumphs raise,
Or sing our great Delivererâ€™s praise?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh how shall we the goodness tell,
Father, which Thou to us hast showed?
Children of wrath, and doomed to hell,
But children now redeemed to God,
On earth we know our sins forgiven,
Blessed with this antepast of Heaven!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Our heart is full of Christ, and long
Their glorious matter to declare!
Of him we make our loftier song,
We cannot from his praise forbear;
Our ready tongue makes haste to sing
The glories of our heavenly King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Fairer than all the earth-born race,
Perfect in comeliness thou art;
Replenished are thy lips with grace,
And full of love thy tender heart:
God ever blest! we bow the knee,
And own all fulness dwells in thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
