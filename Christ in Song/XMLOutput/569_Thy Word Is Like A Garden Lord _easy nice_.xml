With flowers bright and fair
And everyone who seeks may pluck
A lovely cluster there
Thy Word is like a deep deep mine
And jewels rich and rare
Are hidden in its mighty depths
For every searcher there{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy Word is like a starry host
A thousand rays of light
Are seen to guide the traveler
And make his pathway bright
Thy Word is like an armory
Where soldiers may repair
And find for life's long battle day
All needful weapons there{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O may I love Thy precious Word
Many I explore the mine
May I its fragrant flowers glean
May light upon me shine
O may I find my armor there
Thy Word my trusty sword
I'll learn to fight with every foe
The battle of the Lord{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
