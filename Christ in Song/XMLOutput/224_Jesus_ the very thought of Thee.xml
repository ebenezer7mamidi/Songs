With sweetness fills my breast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest Name,
O Savior of mankind!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O Hope of every contrite heart,
O Joy of all the meek,
To those who fall, how kind Thou art!
How good to those who seek!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}But what to those who find? Ah, this
Nor tongue nor pen can show;
The love of Jesus, what it is
None but His loved ones know.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}O Jesus! light of all below!
Thou fount of life and fire!
Surpassing all the joys we know,
And all we can desire.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}No other source have we but Thee,
Soul-thirst to satisfy.
Exhaustless spring! the waters free!
All other streams are dry.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus, our only Joy be Thou,
As Thou our Prize wilt be;
Jesus, be Thou our Glory now,
And through eternity.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
