Urge us on our way
And heart is answering
Heart in signs of pain
Have we no words of
Strengthening joy to say
No songs for those
Who suffer but to reign{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O for the faithful mind
The steadfast eye
To keep our leader's
Glory full in sight
And make our converse
Even while we die
An interchange
Of triumph and delight{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Behold the paths
Of life are ours - we see
Our blest inheritance
Where'er we tread
Sorrow and danger our security
And disappointment
Lifting up our head{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Kings unto God
We may not doubt our power
We may not languish
When He says "Be strong"
We must move on
Through every adverse hour
And take possession
As we pass along{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Yes all is for us
Nothing shall withstand
Our faithful valiant
Persevering claim
The rod of God's
Anointed in our hand
And our assurance
His unchanging name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}We need no haste
Where He has said "Be still"
No peace
Where He has charged us
To contend
Only the fearless
Love to do His will
And to show forth
His honor to the end{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}O ye that faint and die
Arise and live
Sing ye that all things
Have a charge to bless
If He is faithful
Who hath sworn to give
Then be ye also faithful
And possess{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Take thy whole portion
With thy Master's mind
Toil hinderance hardness
With His virtue take
And think how short
A time thy heart may find
To labor or to suffer
For His sake{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
