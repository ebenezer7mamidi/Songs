The truth of God
To our poor reach of mind
By notions of our day and sect
Crude partial and confined
Now let a new and better hope
Within our hearts be stirred
The Lord hath yet
More light and truth
To break forth
From His Word{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Who dare to bind
By his dull sense
The oracles of heaven
For all the nations
Tongues and climes
And all the ages given
The universe how much unknown
That ocean unexplored
The Lord hath yet
More light and truth
To break forth
from His Word{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Darkling our great
Forefathers went
The first steps of the way
'Twas but the dawning
yet to grow
Into the perfect day
And grow it shall
Our glorious Sun
More fervid rays afford
The Lord hath yet
More light and truth
To break forth
From His Word{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}The valleys past
Ascending still
Our souls would higher climb
And look down from
Supernal heights
On all the bygone times
Upward we press
The air is clear
And the sphere-music heard
The Lord hath yet
More light and truth
To break forth
From His Word{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}O Father Son and Spirit send
Us increase from above
Enlarge expand all
Christian hearts
To comprehend
Thy love
And make us all
Go on to know
With nobler powers conferred
The Lord hath yet
More light and truth
To break forth
From His Word{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
