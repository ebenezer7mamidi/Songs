Oh my Strength
Whom all my times obey
Take from me anything Thou wilt
But go not Thou away
And let the storm that does Thy work
Deal with me as it may{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}On Thy compassion I repose
In weakness and distress
I will not ask for greater ease
Lest I should love Thee less
Oh 'tis a blessed thing for me
To need Thy tenderness{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}While many sympathizing hearts
For my deliverance care
Thou in Thy wiser stronger love
Art teaching me to bear
By the sweet voice of thankful song
And calm confiding prayer{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy love has many a lighted path
No outward eye can trace
And my heart sees Thee in the deep
With darkness on its face
And communes with Thee 'mid the storm
As in a secret place{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh Comforter of God's redeemed
Who the world does not see
What hand should pluck me from the flood
That casts my soul on Thee
Who would not suffer pain like mine
To be consoled like me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}When I am feeble as a child
And flesh and heart give way
Then on Thy everlasting strength
With passive trust I stay
And the rough wind becomes a song
The darkness shines like day{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh blessed are the eyes that see
Though silent anguish show
The love that in their hours of sleep
Unthanked may come and go
And blessed are the ears that hear
Though kept awake by woe{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Happy are they that learn in Thee
Though patient suffering teach
The secret of enduring strength
And praise too deep for speeh
Peace that no pressure from without
No strife within can reach{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v9"><lines>{lang-eng}There is no death for me to fear
For Christ my Lord hath died
There is no curse in this my pain
For he was crucified
And it is fellowship with Him
That keeps me near His side
10. My heart is fixed O God my strength
My heart is strong to bear
I will be joyful in Thy love
And peaceful in Thy care
Deal with me for my Savior's sake
According to His prayer
11. No suffering while it last is joy
How blest soe'er it be
Yet may the chastened child be glad
His Father's face to see
And oh it is not hard to bear
What must be borne in Thee
12. It is not hard to bear by faith
In Thy own bosom laid
The trial of a soul redeemed
For Thy rejoicing made
Well may the heart in patience rest
That none can make afraid
13. Safe in Thy sanctifying grace
Almighty to restore
Borne onward sin and death behind
And love and life before
O let my soul abound in hope
And praise Thee more and more
14. Deep unto deep may call - but I
With peaceful heart will say
Thy loving-kindness hath a charge
No waves can take away
And let the storm that speeds me home
Deal with me as it may{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
