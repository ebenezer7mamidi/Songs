How my soul delights to hide
Oh how precious are the lessons
Which I learn at Jesus' side
Earthly cares can never vex me
Neither trials lay me low
For when Satan comes to tempt me
To the secret place I go
To the secret place I go{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When my soul is faint and thirsty
'Neath the shadow of His wing
There is cool and pleasant shelter
And a fresh and crystal spring
And my Savior rests beside me
As we hold communion sweet
If I tried I could not utter
What He says when thus we meet
What He says when thus we meet{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Only this I know I tell Him
All my doubts my griefs and fears
Oh how patiently He listens
And my drooping soul He cheers
Do you think He ne'er reproves me
What a false friend He would be
If He never ever told me
Of the sin which He must see
Of the sin which He must see{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Would you like to know that sweetness
Of the secret of the Lord
Go and hide beneath His shadow
This shall then be your reward
And whene'er you leave the silence
Of that happy meeting-place
You will surely bear the image
Of the Master in your face
Of the Master in your face{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
