Jesus stands
Before the throne of grace;
And clouds of incense from His hands
Fill all that glorious place.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}His precious blood is sprinkled there,
Before and on the throne;
And His own wounds
in heaven declare
His work that saves is done.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}“‘Tis finished!” on the Cross He said,
In agonies and blood;
‘Tis finished! now He lives to plead
Before the face of God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}‘Tis finished! here our souls can rest,
His work can never fail;
By Him, our Sacrifice and Priest,
We enter through the veil.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Within the holiest of all,
Cleansed by His precious blood,
Before Thy throne Thy children fall,
And worship Thee, our God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Boldly our heart and voice we raise,
His Name, His blood, our plea;
Assured our prayers
and songs of praise
Ascend by Him to Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
