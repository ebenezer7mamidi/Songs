The Comforter has come
The Holy Ghost from heav'n
The Father's promise giv'n
Oh spread the tidings 'round
Wherever man is found
The Comforter has come{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh spread the tidings 'round
Wherever man is found
Wherever human hearts
And human woes abound
Let every Christian tongue
Proclaim the joyful sound
The Comforter has come{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The long long night is past
The morning breaks at last
And hushed the dreadful wail
And fury of the blast
As o'er the golden hills
The day advances fast
The Comforter has come{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Lo the great King of kings
With healing in His wings
To every captive soul
A full deliv'rance brings
And through the vacant cells
The song of triumph rings
The Comforter has come{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh boundless love divine
How shall this tongue of mine
To wond'ring mortals tell
The matchless grace divine
That I a child of hell
Should in His image shine
The Comforter has come{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Of lords He is the Lord
Divine the living Word
His name the sweetest heard
His will redemption brings
O spread the tidings 'round
Wherever man is found
The Lord is King of kings{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
