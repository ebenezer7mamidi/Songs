The strength of Satan more
The cry of battle calling now
Is louder than before
The rebel voice of hell
E'en stronger now becomes
But list the midnight cry resounds
Behold I quickly come{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Trials more bitter grow
The fighting doth enlarge
Hell's forces rally all their pow'rs
And gather for the charge
Yet while we wait and watch
And feel the war severe
We hear the joyful song ring out
Jesus the Lord is near{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}'Tis harder at the end
The word to testify
For Satan fights with all his pow'r
Our witness to defy
Much greater strength we need
The foe to overcome
How happy when the Lord we see
And all our sighing's done{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Who then will forward go
Strong in His mighty power
Who then will firmly trust the Lord
Until the vict'ry hour
Till with the conqu'rors blest
The triumph song's begun
That man will then rejoice to hear
Behold I quickly come{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Who then will choose God's best
And take the narrow track
Though passing through the wildest storms
Yet never turnng back
Who now will dare press on
Enduring pain and fear
All such will then rejoice to see
Jesus the Lord is near{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Though deep the darkness be
We still would onward go
Till we the day of rapture greet
And glory 'round shall glow
'Tis there we'll see the Lord
And Satan over come
The overcomers will rejoice
Jesus the Lord has come{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
