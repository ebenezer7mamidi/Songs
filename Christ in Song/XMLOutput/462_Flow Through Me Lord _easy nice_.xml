A weak and earthly vessel
Cleansed by Thy blood
And quickened at Thy call
Flow through me Lord
All utterly abandoned
To Thy dear service
Great or high or small{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Flow through me Lord
With overflowing fullness
Make me to know
Thine own deep love for souls
Work in me Lord
The faith that moveth mountains
As power - Almighty power
My being holds{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Flow through me Lord
Till sin in all its blackness
To captives bound
By Satan is revealed
Flow through me Lord
Till hearts are stricken broken
And in Thy cleansing
Fountain saved and healed{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Flow through me Lord
Till lagging souls are quickened
Till lives of failure
Sing the victory song
Till praise from lips
Long dumb and silent open
And join with rapture
Earth's glad cleansed throng{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Flow through me Lord
Till waters from Thy fountain
Shall slake the thirst
Of souls in deserts drear
Flow through me Lord
Till arid places bloom
With roses fresh
And sweet and wondrous fair{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Flow through me Lord
Set all my heart-strings thrilling
With Thine own love
So matchless perfect free
Flow through me Lord
Till naught in earth or heaven
Can satisfy my being
Lord but Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
