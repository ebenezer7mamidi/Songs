He comes with clouds descending,
Once for favored sinners slain;
Thousand, thousand saints attending,
Swell the triumph of His train:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
God appears on earth to reign.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Every eye shall now behold Him
Robed in dreadful majesty;
Those who set at naught and sold Him,
Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,
Deeply wailing, deeply wailing,
Shall the true Messiah see.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Now redemption, long expected,
See in solemn pomp appear;
All His saints, by man rejected,
Now shall meet Him in the air:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
See the day of God appear!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Lo! the tokens of His passion
Thouigh in glory, Still He bears;
Cause of endless exultation
To His ransomed worshippers;
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Gaze we on those glorious scars!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}'Tis Thy heavenly bride and Spirit,
Jesus Lord! that nid Thee come;
All the glory to inherit,
And to take Thy people home:
All creation, all creation,
Travails, groans, till THou shalt come!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Yea, Amen! let all adore Thee,
High on Thine eternal throne;
Savior, take the power and glory,
Claim the kingdom for Thine own;
O come quickly! O come quickly!
Everlasting God, come down!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
