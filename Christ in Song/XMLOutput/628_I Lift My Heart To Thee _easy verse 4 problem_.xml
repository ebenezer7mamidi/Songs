For Thou art all to me
And I am Thine
Is there on earth
A closer bond than this
That my Beloved's mine
And I am His{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Thine am I by all ties
And chiefly Thine
For through Thy sacrifice
Thou Lord art mine
By Thine own cords of love
So sweetly wound
Around me closely
I to Thee am bound{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}To Thee Thou bleeding Lamb
I all things owe
All that I have and am
And all I know
All that I have is now
No longer mine
And I am not my own
Lord I am Thine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}How can I Lord
Withold life's brightest hour from Thee
or gathered gold or any power
Why should I keep
One precious thing from Thee
When Thou hast given Thine own dear
Self for me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I pray Thee Savior
Keep me in Thy love
Until death's hallowed
Sleep shall me remove
To that fair realm
Where sin and sorrow o'er
Thou and Thine own
Are one for evermore{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
