All my inmost heart hath won
Not a star to cheer my darkness
But a light beyond the sun{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}All below lies dark and shadowed
Nothing there to claim my heart
Save the lonely track of sorrow
Where of old He walked apart
I was journeying in the noontide,
When His light shone o'er my road;
And I saw Him in that glory-
Saw Him-Jesus, Son of God.
All around, in noonday splendour
Earthly scenes lay fair and bright
But my eyes no longer see them
For the glory of that light{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Others in the summer sunshine
Wearily may journey on
I have seen a light from heaven
Past the brightness of the sun
Light that knows no cloud no waning
Light wherein I see His face
All His love's uncounted treasures
All the riches of His grace{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Sinners it was not to Angels
All this wondrous love was given
But to one who scorned despised Him
Scorned and hated Christ in heaven
From the lowest depths of evil
To the throne in heaven above
Thus in me He told the measure
Of His free, unbounded love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}All the wonders of His glory
Deeper wonders of His love
How for me He won He keepeth
That high place in Heaven above
Not a glimpse - the veil uplifted
But within the veil to dwell
Gazing on His face forever
Hearing words unspeakable{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}I have seen the face of Jesus
Tell me not of aught beside
I have heard the voice of Jesus
All my soul is satisfied
In the radiance of the glory
First I saw His blessed face
And forever shall that glory
Be my home my dwelling place{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
