No more in chains of sin I repine!

Freedom from all that saddened my life.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Freedom from pride and all sinful follies,
Freedom from love and glitter of gold;
Freedom from evil temper and anger,

Freedom from care with all of its pain;
Freedom in Christ my blessed Redeemer,
He who has rent my fetters in twain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
