And all His words are sure;
From everlasting unto everlasting,
His promises endure.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Though we may wander, He will not forsake us,
Truer than earthly friend;
He never fails our trust, for having loved us,
He loves unto the end.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Unto the end; we doubt Him, we deny Him,
We wound Him, we forget;
We get some earthly idol up between us,
Without one faint regret.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}And when it falls or crumbles, and in anguish,
We seek this changeless Friend,
Lo, He receives us, comforts and forgives us,
And loves us to the end.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
