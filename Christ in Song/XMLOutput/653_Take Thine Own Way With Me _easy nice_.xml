Thou canst not otherwise than bless
I launch me forth upon a sea
Of boundless love and tenderness{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I could not choose a larger bliss
Than to be wholly Thine and mine
A will whose highest joy is this
To caselessly unclasp in Thine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I will not fear Thee O my God
The days to come can only bring
Their perfect sequences of love
Thy larger deeper comforting{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Within the shadow of this love
Loss doth transmute itself to gain
Faith veils earth's sorrow in its light
And straightway lives above her pain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}We are not losers thus we share
the prefect gladness of the Son
Not conquered for behold we reign
Conquered and Conqueror are one{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy wonderful grand will my God
Triumphantly I make it mine
And faith shall breathe her glad Amen
To every dear command of Thine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Beneath the splendor of Thy choice
Thy perfect choice for me I rest
Outside it now I dare not live
Within it I must needs be blest{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Meanwhile my spirit anchors calm
In grander regions still than this
The fair far-shining latitudes
Of that yet unexplored bliss{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v9"><lines>{lang-eng}Then may Thy perfect glorious will
Be evermore fulfilled in me
And make my life an answering chord
Of glad responsive harmony{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
