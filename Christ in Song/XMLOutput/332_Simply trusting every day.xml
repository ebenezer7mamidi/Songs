Trusting Jesus, that is all.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Simply trusting every day;
Trusting through a stormy way;
Even when my faith is small,

Into this poor heart of mine;

Praying if the path be drear;
If in danger, for Him call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Trusting Him while life shall last,
Trusting Him till earth is past,
Till His gracious advent call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
