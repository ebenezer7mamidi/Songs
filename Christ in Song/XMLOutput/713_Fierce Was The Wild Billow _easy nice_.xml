Dark was the night
Oars laboured heavily
Foam glimmered white
Trembled the mariners
Peril was nigh
Then said the God of God
Peace it is I{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Ridge of the mountain-wave
Lower thy crest
Wail of the hurricane
Be thou at rest
Sorrow can never be
Darkness must fly
Where saith the Light of Light
Peace it is I{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus Deliverer
Nigh to us be
Soothe thou my voyaging
Over Life's sea
Thou when the storm of death
Roars sweeping by
Whisper O Truth of Truth
Peace it is I{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
