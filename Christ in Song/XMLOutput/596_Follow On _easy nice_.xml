Where the flowers are blooming
And the sweet waters flow
Everywhere He leads me

Walking in His footsteps
Till the crown be won{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Down in the valley

And the dark waters flow
With His hand to lead me
I will never never fear
Danger cannot fright me
If my Lord is near{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Down in the valley
Or upon the mountain steep
Close beside my Savior
Would my heart ever keep
He will lead me safely
In the path that He has trod
Up to where they gather
On the hills of God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
