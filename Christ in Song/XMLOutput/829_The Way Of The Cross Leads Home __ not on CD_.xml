The way of the cross leads home
It is sweet to know as I onward go
The way of the cross leads home{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I must needs go home
By the way of the cross
There's no other way but this
I shall ne'er get sight
Of the Gates of Light
If the way of the cross I miss{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I must needs go on
In the blood sprinkled way
The path that the Saviour trod
If I ever climb
To the heights sublime
Where the soul
Is at home with God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Then I bid farewell
To the way of the world
To walk in it never more
For my Lord says "Come"
And I seek my home
Where He waits at the open door{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
