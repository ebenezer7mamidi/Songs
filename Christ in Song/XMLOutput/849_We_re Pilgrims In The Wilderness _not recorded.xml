Our dwelling is a camp
Created things though pleasant
Now bear to us death's stamp
But onward we are speeding
Though often let and tried
The Holy Ghost is leading
Home to the Lamb His bride{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}With fellow pilgrims meeting
As through the waste we roam
'Tis sweet to sing together
"We are not far from home"
And when we've learned our lesson
Our work in suff'ring done
Our ever loving Father
Will welcome every one{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}We look to meet our brethren
From every distant shore
Not one will seem a stranger
Though never seen before
With angel hosts attending
In myriads through the sky
Yet 'midst them all Thou only
O Lord wilt fix the eye{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord since we sing as pilgrims
O give us pilgrims' ways
Low thoughts of self befitting
Proclaimers of Thy praise
O make us each more holy
In spirit pure and meek
More like to heav'nly cit'zens
As more of heav'n we speak{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
