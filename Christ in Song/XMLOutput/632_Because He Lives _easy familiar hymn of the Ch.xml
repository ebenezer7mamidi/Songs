I can face tomorrow
Because He lives
All fear is gone
Because I know
He holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because He lives{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}God sent His Son
They called Him Jesus
He came to love heal and forgive
He bled and died
To buy my pardon
An empty grave
Is there to prove
My Savior lives{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}How sweet to hold
A newborn baby
And feel the pride
And joy he gives
But greater still
The calm assurance
This child can face
Uncertain days
Because Christ lives{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}And then one day
I'll cross that river
I'll fight life's final
War with pain
And then as death
Gives way to vict'ry
I'll see the lights of glory
And I'll know He lives{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
