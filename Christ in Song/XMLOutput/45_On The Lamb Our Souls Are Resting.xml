What His love no tongue can say;
All our sins, so great, so many,
In His blood are washed away.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Sweetest rest and peace have filled us,
Sweeter praise than tongue can tell;
God is satisfied with Jesus,
We are satisfied as well.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Conscience now no more condemns us,
For His own most precious blood
Once for all has washed and cleansed us,
Cleansed us in the eyes of God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Filled with this sweet peace for ever,
On we go, through strife and care,
Till we find that peace around us
In the Lamb's high glory there.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
