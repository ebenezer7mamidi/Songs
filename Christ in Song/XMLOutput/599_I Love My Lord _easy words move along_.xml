But with no love of mine
For I have none to give
I love Thee Lord
But all the love is Thine
For by Thy love I live
I am as nothing
And rejoice to be
Emptied and lost
And swallow'd up in Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou Lord alone art
All Thy children need
And there is none beside
From Thee the streams of
Blessedness proceed
In Thee the bless'd abide
Fountain of life
And all abounding grace
Our source - our center
And our dwelling place{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
