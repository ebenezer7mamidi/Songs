Tidings of peace
Tidings of Jesus
Redemption and release{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}O Zion haste
Your mission high fulfilling
To tell to all the world
That God is light
That He who made all nations
Is not willing
One soul should perish
Lost in shades of night{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Behold how many thousands
Still are lying
Bound in the darksome
Prison-house of sin
With none to tell them
Of the Savior's dying
Or of the life
He died for them to win{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}'Tis thine to save
From peril of perdition
The souls for whom
The Lord His life laid down
Beware lest slothful
To fulfill thy mission
Thou lose one jewel
That should deck His crown{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Proclaim to every people
Tongue and nation
That God in Whom
They live and move is love
Tell how He stooped
To save His lost creation
And died on earth
That men might live above{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Give of thy sons
To bear the message glorious
Give of thy wealth
To speed them on their way
Pour out thy soul for them
In prayer victorious
And all thou spendest
Jesus will repay{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}He comes again
O Zion ere thou meet Him
Make known to every heart
His saving grace
Let none whom He
Hath ransomed
Fail to greet Him
Through thy neglect
Unfit to see His face{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
