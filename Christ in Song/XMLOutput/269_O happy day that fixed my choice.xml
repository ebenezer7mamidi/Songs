When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day;
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}O happy day that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Savior and my God!

And tell its raptures all abroad.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O happy bond, that seals my vows
To Him who merits all my love!
Let cheerful anthems fill His house,
While to that sacred shrine I move.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}’Tis done—the great transaction’s done;

That vow renewed shall daily hear!
Till in life’s latest hour I bow,
And bless, in death, a bond so dear.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
