A moment, and He will be here!
The mists and the shadows are fleeing,
The darkness will soon disappear;
And He, for whom ages have waited,
The Lord Who has tarried so long,
Will come in an outburst of glory,
A moment, and we shall be gone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Watch! for the morning is breaking,
A moment, the crown will be won!
A moment, and we shall be with Him,
A moment, the journey is done!
Lord, keep us each moment unsleeping,
And count us all worthy to be
In that noble band of Thy watchers,
Whose life is a vigil with Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
