by which supported still we stand;
the opening year thy mercy shows;
that mercy crowns it till it close.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}By day, by night, at home, abroad,
still are we guarded by our God;
by his incessant bounty fed,
by his unerring counsel led.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}With grateful hearts the past we own;
the future, all to us unknown,
we to thy guardian care commit,
and peaceful leave before thy feet.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}In scenes exalted or depressed,
thou art our joy, and thou our rest;
thy goodness all our hopes shall raise,
adored through all our changing days.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}When death shall interrupt these songs,
and seal in silence mortal tongues,
our helper God, in whom we trust,
