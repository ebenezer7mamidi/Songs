At his feet we humbly fall,
crown him, crown him, Lord of all!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Who is He in yonder stall,
At whose feet the shepherds fall?
Who is he in deep distress,
fasting in the wilderness?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Who is he the people bless
