Tell me the old old story
Tell me the old old story
Of Jesus and His love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Tell me the old old story
Of unseen things above
Of Jesus and His glory
Of Jesus and His love
Tell me the story simply
As to a little child
For I am weak and weary
And helpless and defiled{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Tell me the story slowly
That I may take it in
That wonderful redemption
God's remedy for sin
Tell me the story often
For I forget so soon
The early dew of morning
Has passed away at noon{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Tell me the story softly
With earnest tones and grave
Remember I'm the sinner
Whom Jesus came to save
Tell me the story always
If you would really be
In any time of trouble
A comforter to me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Tell me the same old story
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory
Is costing me too dear
Yes and when that world's glory
Is dawning on my soul
Tell me the old old story-
Christ Jesus makes thee whole{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
