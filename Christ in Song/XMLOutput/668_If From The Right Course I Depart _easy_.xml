Then ease my lot would be
But I remember how my Lord
Did suffer agony{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I'll utterly forsake this world
And sever all its ties
My path may narrow more and more
And all against me rise{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Though men my scowl and laugh to scorn
I only want His smile
His "well done" only I'd secure
While here this little while{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Not after greatness do I seek
Nor glory here desire
But humbly I would serve the Lord
His praise that day acquire{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I'm daily gazing at the light
Shed from His judgment seat
That all my living and my work
The test of fire may meet{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Let others seek for great success
For glory wealth and name
Let them procure their grandeur here
Their followers and fame{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}In solitude and poverty
Though prospering not in soul
Yet faithfully I'll follow Him
Until I reach the goal{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}I know that when on earth He dwelt
His lot was but the cross
And that is why I only wish
With Him to suffer loss{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v9"><lines>{lang-eng}Since all my glories lie ahead
I must to patience cleave
I will not go before my Lord
And glory here recieve
10. That day my honors I will have
The Lord will dry my tears
So faithfully I'll still press on
Until my Lord appears{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
