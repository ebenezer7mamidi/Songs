Free and changeless is His favor, All is well
Precious is the blood that healed us
Perfect is the grace that sealed us
Strong the hand stretched forth to shield us
All must be well{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Though we pass through tribulation, All will be well
Ours is such a full salvation, All is well
Happy still in God confiding
Fruitful if in Christ abiding
Steadfast through the Spirit's guiding
All must be well{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}We expect a bright tomorrow; All will be well
Faith can sing through days of sorrow, All is well
On our Father's love relying
Jesus every need supplying
Or in living or in dying
All must be well{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
