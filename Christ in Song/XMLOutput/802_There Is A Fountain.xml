Drawn from Emmanuel's veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day
And there may I though vile as he
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
And there may I as vile as he
Wash all my sins away{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Dear dying Lamb Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved to sin no more
Be saved to sin no more
Be saved to sin no more
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved to sin no more{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be til I die
And shall be til I die
And shall be til I die
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be til I die{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}When this poor lisping
Stamm'ring tongue
Lies silent in the grave
Then in a nobler sweeter song
I'll sing thy power to save
I'll sing thy power to save
I'll sing thy power to save
Then in a nobler sweeter song
I'll sing thy power to save{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
