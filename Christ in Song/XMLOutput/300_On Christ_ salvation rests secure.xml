The Rock of Ages must endure;
Nor can that faith be overthrown
Which rests upon the “Living Stone.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}No other hope shall intervene;
To Him we look, on Him we lean;

And build on Christ, the “Living Stone.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In Him it is ordained to raise
A temple to Jehovah’s praise,
