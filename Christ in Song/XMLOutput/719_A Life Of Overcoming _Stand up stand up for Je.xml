A life of ceaseless praise
Be this thy blessed portion
Throughout the coming days
The victory was purchased
On Calv'rys cross for thee
Sin shall not have dominion
The Son hath made thee free{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}And would'st thou know the secret
Of constant victory
Let in the Overcomer
And He will conquer thee
Thy broken spirit taken
In sweet captivity
Shall glory in His triumph
And share His victory{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Though all the path before thee
The host of darkness fill
Look to thy Father's promise
And claim the vict'ry still
Faith sees the heavenly legions
Where doubt sees nought but foes
And through the very conflict
Her life the stronger grows{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}More stern will grow the conflict
As nears our King's return
And they alone can face it
Who this great lesson learn
That from them God asks nothing
But to unlatch the door
Admitting Him who through them
Will conquer evermore{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
