Far, far behind me!
I’ve crossed the separating line,
And left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="c2"><lines>{lang-eng}Far, far behind me!
Far, far behind me!
I’ve passed in Christ from death to life,
And left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="c3"><lines>{lang-eng}Far, far behind me!
Far, far behind me!
And once for all I’ve left the world,
Yes, left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="c4"><lines>{lang-eng}Far, far behind me!
Far, far behind me!
I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death,
And left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I’ve turned my back upon the world
With all its idle pleasures,
And set my heart on better things,
On higher, holier treasures;
No more its glitter and its glare,
And vanity shall blind me;
I’ve crossed the separating line,
And left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I’ve left the old sad life of sin,
Its follies all forsaken;
My standing place is now in Christ,
His holy vows I’ve taken;
Beneath the standard of the cross
The world henceforth shall find me;
I’ve passed in Christ from death to life,
And left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}My soul shall ne’er return again
Back to its former station
For here alone is perfect peace,
And rest from condemnation;
I’ve made exchange of masters now,
The vows of glory bind me,
And once for all I’ve left the world,
Yes, left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}My choice is made forevermore,
I want no other Savior;
I ask no purer happiness
Than His sweet love and favor;
My heart is fixed on Jesus Christ,
No more the world shall blind me;
I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death,
And left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
