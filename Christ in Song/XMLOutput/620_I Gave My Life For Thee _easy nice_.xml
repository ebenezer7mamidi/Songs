My precious blood I shed
That thou might'st ransomed be
And quickened from the dead
For thee for thee I gave My life
What hast thou given for Me
For thee for thee I gave My life
What hast thou given for Me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I spent long years for thee
In weariness and woe
That an eternity of joy
Thou mightest know
For thee for thee I spent long years
Hast thou spent one for Me
For thee for thee I spent long years
Hast thou spent one for Me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}My Father's house of light
My rainbow-circled throne
I left for earthly night
For wand'rings sad and lone
For thee for thee I left it all
Hast thou left aught for Me
For thee for thee I left it all
Hast thou left aught for Me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I suffered much for thee
More than thy tongue can tell
Of bitt'rest agony
To rescue thee from hell
For thee for thee I suffered much
What canst thou bear for Me
For thee for thee I suffered much
What canst thou bear for Me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}And I have bro't to thee
Down from My home above
Salvation full and free
My pardon and My love
To thee to thee great gifts I brought
What hast thou brought to Me
To thee to thee great gifts I brought
What hast thou brought to Me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord let my life be given
And every moment spent
For God for souls for heaven
And all earth's ties be rent
For me for me Thou gavest Thy self
Now I give all for Thee
For me for me Thou gavest Thy self
Now I give all for Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
