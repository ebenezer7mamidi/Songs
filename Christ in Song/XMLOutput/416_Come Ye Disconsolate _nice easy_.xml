Where'er ye languish
Come to the mercy seat
Fervently kneel
Here bring
Your wounded hearts
Here tell your anguish
Earth has no sorrows
That heav'n cannot heal{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Joy of the comfortless
Light of the straying
Hope of the penitent
Fadeless and pure
Here speaks
The Comforter
In mercy saying
Earth has no sorrows
That heav'n cannot cure{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Here see the Bread of Life
See waters flowing
Forth from the throne of God
Pure from above
Come to the feast prepared
Come ever knowing
Earth has no sorrows
But heav'n can remove{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
