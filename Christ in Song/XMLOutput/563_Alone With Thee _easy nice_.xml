Alone with Thee
O friend divine
Thou friend of friends
To me most dear
Though all unseen
I feel Thee near
And with the love
That knows no fear
I call Thee mine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Alone with Thee
Alone with Thee
Now through my breast
There steals a breath
Like breath of balm
That healing brings
And holy calm
That soothes like
Chanted song or psalm
And makes me blest{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Alone with Thee
Alone with Thee
Thy grace more sweet
Than music in the
Twilight still
Than airs that
Groves of spices fill
More fresh than
Dews on Hermon's hill
My soul doth greet{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Alone with Thee
Alone with Thee
In Thy pure light
The splendid pomps
And shows of time
The tempting steeps
That pride would climb
The peaks where
Glory rest sublime
Pale on my sight{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Alone with Thee
Alone with Thee
My softened heart
Floats on the flood
Of love divine
Feels all its wishes
Drowned in Thine
Content that every
Good is mine
Thou canst impart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Alone with Thee
Alone with Thee
I want no more
To make my earthly
Bliss complete
Than oft my Lord
Unseen to meet
For sight I wait
Till tread my feet
Yon glistering shore{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Alone with Thee
Alone with Thee
There not alone
But with all saints
The mighty throng
My soul unfettered
Pure and strong
Her high communings
Shall prolong
Before Thy throne{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
