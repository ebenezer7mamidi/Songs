Our equal cause of peace and pow'r
Thou for our sins didst once atone
Thou art our life of life this hour{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}On Thee were our transgressions laid
On Thee the Law's pure lightnings shed
The member's debt of doom was paid
By unknown sufferings of the Head{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}And now in toil temptation strife
Still from their Head's exhaustless well
The members draw new streams of life
The world the flesh the fiend to quell{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Deep through the springs of mind and soul
Thee the great Comforter inspires
Thy sovereign thoughts our thought control
Thy love our love divinely fire{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}To know to do the Head's commands
For this the Body lives and grows
All speed of feet and skill of hands
For Thee is spent and from Thee flows{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Then Lord in strong communion still
Oh faster bind us to be free
Thou working out by us Thy will
We working out Thy will by Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
