It is our victory
Not on ourselves do we rely
But mighty Lord on Thee
Our weapons are not arms of flesh
But ours the Spirit's Sword
And God's whole armor putting on
We battle in the Lord{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Behold the foe doth meet and plot
Stand firm in one accord
Tho war be fierce and darkness thick
Resist him in the Lord
If one through fear should backward turn
He undermines the rest
Oh do not let your brothers down
Nor by you be distressed{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The devil knows his time is short
He is the more enraged
And by his wiles would weaken us
Before the battle's waged
The trials now more numerous are
The suff'ring e'en more sore
The force of hell opposing us
More dreadful than before{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}What should our posture be today
In such a desperate hour
Should we our ease and pleasure seek
And let the foe devour
Or with increasing conflict strong
Courageous to endure
'Tis here that life or death is won
Who will God's praise secure{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}For Christ the Lord we then would stand
He is the Conqueror
For Him we would endure the pain
Until the fight is o'er
The hour of triumph soon we'll see
The Lord will come again
If now we suffer for His sake
Then we with Him shall reign{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
