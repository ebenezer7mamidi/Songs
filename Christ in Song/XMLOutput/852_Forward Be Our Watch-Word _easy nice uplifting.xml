Steps and voices joined
Seek the things before us
Not a look behind
Burns the fiery pillar
At our army's head
Who shall dream of shrinking
By our Captain led
Forward through the desert
Thru the toil and fight
Canaan lies before us
Zion beams with light{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Forward flock of Jesus
Salt of all the earth
Till each yearning purpose
Spring to glorious birth
Sick they ask for healing
Blind they grope for day
Pour upon the nations
Wisdom's loving ray
Forward out of error
Leave behind the night
Forward through the darkness
Forward into light{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Glories upon glories
Hath our God prepared
By the souls that love Him
One day to be shared
Eye hath not beheld them
Ear hath never heard
Nor of these hath uttered
Thought or speech a word
Forward ever forward
Clad in armour bright
Till the veil be lifted
Till our faith be sight{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
