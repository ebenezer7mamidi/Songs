How wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! How wonderful!
Is my Savior’s love for me!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned, unclean.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}For me it was in the garden,
He prayed: “Not my will, but Thine.”
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat-drops of blood for mine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To strengthen Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv’ry,
And suffered, and died alone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
’Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
