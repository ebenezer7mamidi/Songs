I sing because I'm free
For His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Why should I feel discouraged
Why should the shadows come
Why should my heart be lonely
And long for heav'n and home
When Jesus is my portion
My constant Friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Let not your heart be troubled
His tender words I hear
And resting on His goodness
I lose my doubts and fears
Though by the path He leadeth
But one step I may see
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Whenever I am tempted
Whenever clouds arise
When songs give place to sighing
When hope within me dies
I draw the closer to Him
From care He sets me free
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
