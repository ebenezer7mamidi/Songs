Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o’er my soul like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
Since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,
Since Jesus came into my heart!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I have ceased from my wand’ring and going astray,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

Since Jesus came into my heart!
And I’m happy, so happy as onward I go,
Since Jesus came into my heart!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
