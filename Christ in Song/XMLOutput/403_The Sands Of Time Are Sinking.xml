Are sinking
The dawn
Of heaven breaks
The summer morn
I've sighed for
The fair sweet
Morn awakes
Dark dark
Hath been the midnight
But dayspring is at hand
And glory glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O Christ!
He is the fountain
The deep sweet well of love
The streams
On earth I've tasted
More deep I'll drink above
There to an ocean's fullness
His mercies doth expand
And glory glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}With mercy
And with judgment
My web of time He wove
And aye the dews
Of sorrow
Were lustered
With His love
I'll bless the hand
That guided
I'll bless the heart
That planned
When throned
Where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh I am my Beloved's
And my Beloved's mine
He brings a poor vile sinner
Into his house of wine.
I stand upon His merit
I know no other stand
Not e'en
Where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}The Bride eyes not her garment
But her
dear Bridegroom's face
I will not gaze at glory
But on my King of grace
Not at the crown He giveth
But on His pierced hand
The Lamb is all the glory
Of Immanuel's land{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
