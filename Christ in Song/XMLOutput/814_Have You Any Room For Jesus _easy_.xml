Swing the heart's door widely open
Bid Him enter while you may{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Have you any room for Jesus
He who bore your load of sin
As He knocks and asks admission
Sinner will you let Him in{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Room for pleasure room for business
But for Christ the crucified
Not a place that He can enter
In the heart for which He died{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Have you any room for Jesus
As in grace He calls again
O today is time accepted
Tomorrow you may call in vain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Room and time now give to Jesus
Soon will pass God's day of grace
Soon thy heart left cold and silent
And thy Savior's pleading cease{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
