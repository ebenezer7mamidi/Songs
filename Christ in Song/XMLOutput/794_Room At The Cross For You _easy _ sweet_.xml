There's room at the cross for you
Though millions have come
There's still room for one
Yes there's room at the cross for you{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}The cross upon which Jesus died
Is a shelter in which we can hide
And its grace so free is sufficient for me
And deep is its fountain as wide as the sea{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Though millions have found Him a friend
And have turned from the sins they have sinned
The Savior still waits to open the gates
And welcome a sinner before it's too late{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The hand of my Savior is strong
And the love of my Savior is long
Through sunshine or rain through loss or in gain
The blood flows from Calvary to cleanse every stain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
