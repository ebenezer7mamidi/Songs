Constantly abiding, rapture divine;
He never leaves me lonely, whispers, O, so kind:
“I will never leave thee,” Jesus is mine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}There’s a peace in my heart that the world never gave,
A peace it cannot take away;
Tho' the trials of life may surround like a cloud,
I’ve a peace that has come there to stay!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}All the world seemed to sing of a Savior and King,
When peace sweetly came to my heart;
Troubles all fled away and my night turned to day,
Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}This treasure I have in a temple of clay,
While here on His footstool I roam:
But He’s coming to take me some glorious day,
Over there to my heavenly home!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
