Only Christ I'll sing
Everything is in Christ
And Christ is ev'ry-thing{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Once it was the blessing
Now it is the Lord
Once it was the feeling
Now it is His Word
Once His gift I wanted
Now the Giver own
Once I sought for healing
Now Himself alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Once 'twas painful trying
Now 'tis perfect trust
Once a half salvation
Now the uttermost
Once 'twas ceaseless holding
Now He holds me fast
Once 'twas constant drifting
Now my anchor's cast{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Once 'twas busy planning

Once 'twas constant asking
Now 'tis ceaseless praise{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Once it was my working

Now He uses me
Once the pow'r I wanted
Now the Mighty One
Once for self I labored
Now for Him alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Once I hoped in Jesus
Now I know He's mine
Once my lamps were dying
Now they brightly shine
Once for death I waited
Now his coming hail
And my hopes are anchored
Safe within the veil{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
