Let me to Thy bosom fly
While the near waters roll
While the tempest still is high
Hide me O my Savior hide
Till the storm of life is past
Safe into the haven guide
O receive my soul at last{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Other refuge have I none
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee
Leave oh leave me not alone
Still support and comfort me
All my trust on Thee is stayed
All my help from Thee I bring
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou O Christ art all I want
More than all in Thee I find
Raise the fallen cheer the faint
Heal the sick and lead the blind
Just and holy is Thy name
I am all unrighteousness
Vile and full of sin I am
Thou art full of truth and grace{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Plenteous grace with Thee is found
Grace to cover all my sin
Let the healing streams abound
Make and keep me pure within
Thou of life the fountain art
Freely let me take of Thee
Spring Thou up within my heart
Rise to all eternity{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
