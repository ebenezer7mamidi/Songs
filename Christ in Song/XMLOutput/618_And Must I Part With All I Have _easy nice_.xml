My dearest Lord for Thee
It is but right since Thou hast done
Much more than this for me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Yes let it go - one look from Thee
Will more than make amends
For all the losses I sustain
Of credit - riches - friends{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Ten thousand worlds
Ten thousand lives
How worthless they appear
Compar'd with Thee
Supremely good
Divinely bright and fair{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Savior of souls
Could I from Thee
A single smile obtain
Though destitute
Of all things else
I'd glory in my gain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
