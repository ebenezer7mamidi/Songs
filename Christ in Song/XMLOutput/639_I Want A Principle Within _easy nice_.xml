Of watchful godly fear
A sensibility of sin
A pain to feel it near
Help me the first approach to feel
Of pride or wrong desire
To catch the wandering of my will
And quench the kindling fire{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}From Thee that I no more may stray
No more Thy goodness grieve
Grant me the filial awe I pray
The tender conscience give
Quick as the apple of an eye
O God my conscience make
Awake my soul when sin is nigh
And keep it still awake{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Almighty God of truth and love
To me Thy power impart
The burden from my soul remove
The hardness from my heart
O may the least omission pain
My reawakened soul
And drive me to that grace again
Which makes the wounded whole{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
