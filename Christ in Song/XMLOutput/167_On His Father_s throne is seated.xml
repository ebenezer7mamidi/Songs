Christ the Lord, the living One!
All His toil on earth completed,
All His work for sinners done.
In the glory, in the glory,
See Him—God’s eternal Son!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Every knee shall bow before Him,
Every tongue confess His name,
Ransomed myriads shall adore Him,
Who endured the sinner’s shame!
From the glory, from the glory,
God doth now His worth proclaim.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Man, the cross to Him awarded;
Man, the Savior crucified;

Christ was claimed on earth who died.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Son of Man, His incarnation
Opened first the tale of grace;
Son of Man, in new creation
Leader of a chosen race!
Well may glory, well may glory,
Give to Him the honored place!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
