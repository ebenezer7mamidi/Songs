The nights more weary grow
And Jesus may still tarry
But this one thing I know
The Lord will still grow dearer
And fellowship will be
The closer and the sweeter
Between my Lord and me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}'Tis our dear lord we wait for
Our Hope - our Joy - our Friend
Himself we long to welcome
And just beyond the bend
Hidden perchance to meet us
Before the day is done
The waiting will be over
And heaven will have begun{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
