Of sorrow and weeping
The valley of trouble and pain
But the God of all comfort
The God of all comfort
Was with me to hold and sustain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}As the earth needs the clouds
And the rain with the sunshine
Our souls need both
Sorrow and joy
So He places us oft
In the fire of affliction
The dross from the
Gold to destroy{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When He leads thru
The valleys of
Trouble and sorrow
His mercy and love
There we trace
For the trials and sorrows
He sends us in wisdom
Are part of His
Lessons in grace{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Yet how often we shrink
From the purging and prunning
Forgetting the
Husbandman knows
That the deeper and closer
The cutting and paring
Ther richer the
Cluster that grows{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}O how well does He know
That afflictions are needed
He has a wise purpose in view
And within the dark valley
He whispers to comfort
Hereafter thou'lt know
What I do{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}As we travel the pathway
Through life's shadowed valleys
Fresh springs of
His love ever rise
And we learn that our troubles
Our sorrows and losses
Are blessings just
Sent in disguise{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}So we'll follow Him faithfully
Where'er He leadeth
The pathway be dreary or bright
For we've proved that our God
Is the God of all Comfort
The God who gives
Songs in the night{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
