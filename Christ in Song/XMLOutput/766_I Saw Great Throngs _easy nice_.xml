Linked with each other in one Body here
Each in close union with the living head
The witnesses by Jesus' Spirit lead{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}At every time in every clime I found
Those not with words to Christ but Spirit bound
He strengthens them with might each day each hour
Through them true works divine are wrought in power{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}This is the Church the Spirit hath begot
Elect from every people Christ thier lot
They follow where His shepherd-staff doth lead
The members of this host are blessed indeed{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}And when on earth they meet His death to show
To Him their vows of love they oft renew
Some little flock will gather there or here
Christ Head of all to every soul most near{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}This is the temple which our Lord approves
The Church which truly honors Him and loves
Whose sacrifice is on the altar bound
She soon in glory will His throne surround{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
