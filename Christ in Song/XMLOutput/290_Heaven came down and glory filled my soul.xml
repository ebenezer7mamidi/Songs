When at the cross the Savior made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}O what a wonderful wonderful day
Day I will never forget
After I'd wandered in darkness away
Jesus my Savior I met
O what a tender compassionate friend
He met the need of my heart
Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling
He made all the darkness depart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God's fam'ly divine
Justified fully through Calvary's love
O what a standing is mine
And the transaction so quickly was made
When as a sinner I came
Took of the offer of grace
He did proffer He saved me
O praise His dear name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Now I've a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time
I have a future in heaven for sure
There in those mansions sublime
And it's because of that wonderful day
When at the cross I believed
Riches eternal and blessings supernal
From His precious hand I received{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
