and the day is at the spring,
When our eyes shall see the beauty
and the glory of the King;
Weary was our heart with waiting, and
the night-watch seemed so long,
But His triumph-day is breaking, and
we hail it with a song.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}In the fading of the starlight we can
see the coming morn;
And the lights of men are paling in
the splendors of the dawn;
For the eastern skies are glowing as
with lights of hidden fire,
And the hearts of men are stirring
with the throb of deep desire.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There’s a hush of expectation, and
a quiet in the air;
And the breath of God is moving in
the fervent breath of prayer;
For the suffering, dying Jesus is the
Christ upon the throne,
And the travail of our spirit is the
travail of His own.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}He is breaking down the barriers,
He is casting up the way;
He is calling for His angels to build
up the gates of day;
But His angels here are human, not
the shining hosts above,
For the drum-beats of His army are
the heart-beats of our love.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Hark! we hear a distant music, and
it comes with fuller swell;
’Tis the triumph song of Jesus, of
our King Emmanuel;
Zion, go ye forth to meet Him,
and my soul, be swift to bring
All thy sweetest and thy dearest for
the triumph of our King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
