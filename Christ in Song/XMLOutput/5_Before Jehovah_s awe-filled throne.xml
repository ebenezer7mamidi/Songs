Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;
Know that the Lord is God alone;
He can create, and He destroy,
He can create, and He destroy.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}His sovereign power, without our aid,
Made us of clay, and formed us men;
And when like wandering sheep we strayed,
He brought us to His fold again,
He brought us to His fold again.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}We are His people, we His care,
Our souls, and all our mortal frame;
What lasting honors shall we rear,
Almighty Maker, to Thy Name,
Almighty Maker, to Thy Name?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}We’ll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs,
High as the heavens our voices raise;
And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise,
Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Wide as the world is Thy command,
Vast as eternity Thy love;
Firm as a rock Thy truth must stand,
When rolling years shall cease to move,
When rolling years shall cease to move.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
