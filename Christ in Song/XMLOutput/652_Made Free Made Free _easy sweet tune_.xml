Bound by the law of sin
The law of life in Spirit
Will quicken you within
And counting on the Spirit
His life shall now control
The member of your body
The portals of your soul{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Made free made free in Jesus
For crucified with him
From center to circumference
He breaks the power of sin
No longer act in body
As if it had no law
His law of life must govern
All that ran wild before{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Made free made free in Jesus
Deep planted in His death
He liberates His life pow'r
And breathes His Spirit's breath
Then waxing strong in spirit
With force of quickening life
The soul and body governed
Its members cease from strife{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Made free made free in Jesus
Joined to the Risen One
By conflict prayer you triumph
And claim His victory won
Freed with His glorious freedom
Above the darkness rife
For now the law of sin and death
Is conquered by His life{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
