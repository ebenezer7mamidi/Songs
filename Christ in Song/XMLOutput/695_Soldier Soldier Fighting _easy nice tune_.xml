In the world's great strife
On thyself relying
Battling for thy life
Trust thyself no longer
Trust to Christ - He's stronger
I can all things - all things do
Through Christ who strengthens me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}In your daily duty
Standing up for right
Are you sometimes weary heart
Not always light
Doubt your Savior never
This your secret ever
I can all things - all things do
Through Christ who strengthens me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}If your way be weary
He will help you through
Help you in your troubles
And your pleasures too
Say when Satan's by you
Say when all things try you
I can all things - all things do
Through Christ who strengthens me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}In a world of trouble
Tempted oft to stray
You need never stumble
Satan cannot stay
Will but tempt you vainly
If you tell him plainly
I can all things - all things do
Through Christ who strengthens me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus' power is boundless
Boundless as the sea
He is always able - able to keep me
Power bring from my weakness
Glory from my meekness
I can all things - all things do
Through Christ who strengthens me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
