To thee are burdens, thorns and snares;
They cast dishonor on the Lord,
And contradict His gracious word.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Brought safely by His hand thus far,
Why wilt thou now give place to fear?
How canst thou want if He provide,
Or lose thy way with such a Guide?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When first before His mercy-seat
Thou didst to Him thine all commit;
He gave thee warrant from that hour
To trust His wisdom, love, and power.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Did ever trouble yet befall,
And He refuse to hear thy call?
And has He not His promise passed,
That thou shalt overcome at last?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}He who has helped me hitherto
Will help me all my journey through,
And give me daily cause to raise
New Ebenezers to His praise.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Though rough and thorny be the road,
It leads thee on, apace, to God;
Then count thy present trials small,
For God will make amends for all.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
