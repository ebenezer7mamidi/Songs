Sweeping thru the gates of the New Jerusalem,
"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Who, who are these beside the chilly wave,
Just on the borders of the silent grave,
shouting Jesus' pow'r to save,
"Washed in the blood of the Lamb"?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}These, these are they who, in their youthful days,
found Jesus early, and in wisdom's ways,
Proved the fullness of His grace,
"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}These, these are they who, in affliction's woes,

Such as from a pure heart flows,
"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}These, these are they who, in the conflict dire,
Boldly have stood amid the hottest fire;
Jesus now says, "Come up higher!"

Sin, pain, and death, and sorrow, all are o'er,
Happy now and evermore,
"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
