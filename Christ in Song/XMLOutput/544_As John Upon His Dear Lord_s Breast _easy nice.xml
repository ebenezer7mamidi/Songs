His dear Lord's breast
So would I lean
so would I rest
As empty shell
In depths of sea
So would I sink
Be filled with Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}As singing bird
in high blue air
So would I soar
And sing Thee there
Nor rain nor stormy wind can be
When all the air is full of Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}And so though
Daily duties crowd
And dust of earth
Be like a cloud
Through noise of words
O Lord my Rest
Thy John would lean
Upon Thy breast{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
