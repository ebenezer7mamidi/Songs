Come and quench this thirsting of my soul
Bread of heaven feed me till I want no more
Fill my cup fill it up and make me whole{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Like the woman at the well I was seeking
For things that could not satisfy
And then I heard my Savior speaking
Draw from my well that never shall run dry{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}There are millions in this world who are craving
The pleasures earthly things afford
But none can match the wondrous treasure
That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}So my brother if the things this world gave you
Leave hungers that won't pass away
My blessed Lord will come and save you
If you kneel to Him and humbly pray{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
