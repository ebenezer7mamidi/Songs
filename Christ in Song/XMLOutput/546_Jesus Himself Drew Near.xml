And joined them as they walked
And soon their hearts
Began to burn
As of Himself He talked
Draw near O Lord
Draw near O Lord{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus Himself drew near
They were no longer sad
When He was walking
At their side
How could they but be glad
Draw near O Lord
Draw near O Lord{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus Himself drew near
And all their doubts were solved
He showed them why
Christ came to die
And what that death involved
Draw near O Lord
Draw near O Lord{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus Himself drew near
And at the journey's end
They could not let Him
Leave them thus
The Stranger was their friend
Draw near O Lord
Draw near O Lord{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
