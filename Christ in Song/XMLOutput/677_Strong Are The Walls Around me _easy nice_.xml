That hold me all the day
But they who thus have bound me
Cannot keep God away
My very dungeon walls are dear
Because the God I love is here{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}They know who thus oppress me
'Tis hard to be alone
But know not One can bless me
Who comes through bars and stone
He makes my dungeon's darkness bright
And fills my bosom with delight{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy love O God restores me
From sighs and tears to praise
And deep my soul adores Thee
Nor thinks of time or place
I ask no more in good or ill
But union with Thy holy will{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}'Tis that which makes my treasure
'Tis that which brings my gain
Converting woe to pleasure
And reaping joy from pain
Oh 'tis enough whate'er befall
To know that God is All in all{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
