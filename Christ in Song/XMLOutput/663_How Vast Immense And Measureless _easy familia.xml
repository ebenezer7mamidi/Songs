The love of Christ to me
How else could such a wretch as I
Be blessed so wondrously
Be blessed so wondrously{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}To bring me back unto Himself
My Lord His all did spend
So I would gladly bear the cross
And follow to the end
And follow to the end{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}My all I have forsaken now
This blessed Christ to gain
Now life or death is no concern
What else can me restrain
What else can me restrain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}My dear ones wealth ambition fame
What can they offer me
My gracious Lord for me was poor
For Him I poor would be
For Him I poor would be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}My precious Savior now I love
His smile I would obtain
For Him let gain be turned to loss
And comfort turned to pain
And comfort turned to pain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou art my comfort gracious Lord

And who but Thee is there on earth
With whom I love to be
With whom I love to be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Though loneliness and hardships come

This only would I ask Thee Lord
Enfold me in Thy love
Enfold me in Thy love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}O gracious Lord I now beseech
Guide me through every stage
Stand by and strengthen me to go
Through this dark evil age
Through this dark evil age{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v9"><lines>{lang-eng}The world the flesh and Satan too
Do tempt my soul apace
Without Thy love and
Strength'ning power
I may Thy name disgrace
I may Thy name disgrace
10. The time dear Lord is short indeed
From earth my soul set free
When Thou dost come I'll sing with joy
Hallelujah Lord to Thee
Hallelujah Lord to Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
