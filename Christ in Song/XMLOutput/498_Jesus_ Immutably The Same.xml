Thou true and living vine
Around Thy all supporting stem
My feeble arms I twine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Quickened by Thee and kept alive
I flourish and bear fruit
My life I fromThy sap derive
My vigor from Thy root{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Grafted in Thee by grace alone
In growth I daily rise
And raised on this foundation-stone
My top shall reach the skies{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I can do nothing without thee
My strength is wholly Thine
Withered and barren should I be
If severed from the vine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Upon my leaf when parched with heat
Refreshing dew shall drop
The plant which Thy right hand hath set
Shall ne'er be rooted up{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Till Thou hast led me to the place
Of pure immortal joy
The riches of Thy glorious grace
Shall all my need supply{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Who from eternity decreed
To glorify His own
Will not forske the holy seed
Nor take away their crown{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}The righteous shall hold on their way
Nor miss the promised land
Jesus shall guard them night and day
And hide them in His hand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v9"><lines>{lang-eng}Each moment watered by Thy care
And fenced with power divine
Fruit to eternal life shall bear
The feeblest branch of Thine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
