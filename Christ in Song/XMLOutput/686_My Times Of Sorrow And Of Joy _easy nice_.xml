Great God are in Thy hand
My choicest comforts come from Thee
And go at Thy command{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}If Thou shouldst take them all away
Yet would I not repine
Before they were possesed by me
They were entirely Thine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Nor would I drop a murmuring word
Though the whole world were gone
But seek enduring happiness
In Thee and Thee alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}What is the world with all its store
'Tis but a bitter sweet
When I attempt to pluck the rose
A pricking thorn I meet{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Here perfect bliss can ne'er be found
The honey's mixed with gall
Midst changing scenes and dying friends
Be Thou my all in all{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
