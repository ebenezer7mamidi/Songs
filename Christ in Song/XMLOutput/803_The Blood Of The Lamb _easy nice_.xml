Whiter than the snow whiter than the snow
Whit...................er than the snow
Whiter than the snow whiter than the snow
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb of the Lamb
And I shall be whiter than snow
than snow{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Blessed by the fountain of blood
To a world of sinners revealed
Blessed be the dear Son of God
Only by His stripes we are healed
Tho' I've wandered far from His fold
Bringing to my heart pain and woe
Wash me in the blood of the Lamb
And I shall be whiter than snow{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Thorny was the crown that He wore
And the cross His body o'ercame
Grievous were the sorrows He bore
But He suffered thus not in vain
May I to that fountain be led
Made to cleanse my sins here below
Wash me in the blood that he shed
And I shall be whiter than snow{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Father I have wandered from Thee
Often has my heart gone astray
Crimson do my sins seem to me
Water cannot wash them away
Jesus to that fountain of Thine
Leaning on Thy promise I go
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine
And I shall be whiter than snow{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
