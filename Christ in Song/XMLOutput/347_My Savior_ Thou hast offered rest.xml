Oh, give it then to me;
The rest of ceasing from myself,
To find my all in Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}This cruel self, oh, how it strives
And works within my breast,
To come between Thee and my soul,
And keep me back from rest.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}How many subtle forms it takes
Of seeming verity,
As if it were not safe to rest
And venture all on Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O Lord, I seek a holy rest,
A victory over sin;
I seek that Thou alone shouldst reign
O’er all without, within.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}In Thy strong hand I lay me down,
So shall the work be done;
For who can work so wondrously
As the Almighty One?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Work on, then, Lord, till on my soul
Eternal light shall break,
And, in Thy likeness perfected,
I “satisfied” shall wake.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
