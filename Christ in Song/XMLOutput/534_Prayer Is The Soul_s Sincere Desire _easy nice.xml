The falling of a tear
The upward glancing of an eye
When none but God is near{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Prayer is the simplest form of speech

Prayer the sublimest strains that reach
The Majesty on high{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Prayer is the Christian's vital breath
