My trust in Him repose;
And every hour in perfect peace,
I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows”;
And every hour in perfect peace,
I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I know not what awaits me,
God kindly veils my eyes,
And o’er each step of my onward way
He makes new scenes to rise;
And every joy He sends me comes
A sweet and glad surprise.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}One step I see before me,
’Tis all I need to see,
The light of heaven more brightly shines
When earth’s illusions flee;
And sweetly through the silence comes,
His loving, “Trust in Me!”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, blissful lack of wisdom,
’Tis blessed not to know;
He holds me with His own right hand,
And will not let me go,
And lulls my troubled soul to rest
In Him who loves me so.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}So on I go not knowing;
I would not if I might;
I’d rather walk in the dark with God
Than go alone in the light;
I’d rather walk by faith with Him
Than go alone by sight.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
