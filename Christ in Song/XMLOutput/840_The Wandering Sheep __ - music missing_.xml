I did not love the fold
I did not love my Shepherds voice
I would not be controlled
I was a wayward child
I did not love my home
I did not love my Father's voice
I loved afar to roam{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The Shepherd sought His sheep
The Father sought His child
He followed me o'er vale and hill
O'er deserts waste and wild
They found me nigh to death
Famished and faint and lone
They bound me with the bands of love
He saved the wand'ring one{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus my Shepherd is
'Twas He that loved my soul
'Twas He that washed me in His blood
'Twas He that made me whole
'Twas He that sought the lost
That found the wand'ring sheep
'Twas He that brought me to the fold
'Tis He that still doth keep{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I was a wand'ring sheep
I would not be controlled
But now I love my Savior's voice
I love I love the fold
I was a wayward child
I once preferred to roam
But now I love my Father's voice
I love I love His home{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
