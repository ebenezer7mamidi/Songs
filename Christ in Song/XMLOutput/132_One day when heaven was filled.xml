Buried, He carried my sins far away;
Rising, He justified freely forever:
One day He’s coming—O glorious day!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}One day when heaven was filled with His praises,
One day when sin was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin—
Dwelt among men, my example is He!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain,
One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected;
Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}One day they left Him alone in the garden,
One day He rested, from suffering free;
Angels came down o’er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless, my Savior is He.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled away from the door;
Then He arose, over death He had conquered;
Now is ascended, my Lord evermore.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,
One day the skies with His glory will shine;
Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Savior, this Jesus is mine!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
