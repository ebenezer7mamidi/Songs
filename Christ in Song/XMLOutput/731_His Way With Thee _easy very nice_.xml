What you ought to be
His blood can cleanse your heart
And make you free
His love can fill your soul
And you will see
'Twas best for Him
To have His way with thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Would you live for Jesus
And be always pure and good
Would you walk with Him
Within the narrow road
Would you have Him bear your burden
Carry all your load
Let Him have His way with thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Would you have Him make you free
And follow at His call
Would you know the peace
That comes by giving all
Would you have Him save you
So that you need never fall
Let Him have His way with thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Would you in His kingdom
Find a place of constant rest
Would you prove Him true
In providential test
Would you in His service labor
Always at your best
Let Him have His way with thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
