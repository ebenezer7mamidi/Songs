I cannot stand alone
I have no strength or goodness
No wisdom of my own
But Thou beloved Savior
Art all in all to me
And weakness will be power
If leaning hard on Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I could not do without Thee
For oh the way is long
And I am often weary
And sigh replaces song
How could I do without Thee
I do not know the way
Thou knowest and Thou leadest
And wilt not let me stray{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I could not do without Thee
O Jesus Savior dear
E'en when my eyes are holden
I know that Thou art near
How dreary and how lonely
This changeful life would be
Without the sweet communion
The secret rest with Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I could not do without Thee
No other friend can read
The spirit's strange deep longings
Interpreting its need
No human heart could enter
Each dim recess of mine
And soothe and hush and calm it
O blessed Lord but Thine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I could not do without Thee
For years are fleeting fast
And soon in solemn lonliness
The river must be passed
But thou wilt never leave me
And though the waves roll high
I know Thou wilt be near me
And whisper "It is I"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
