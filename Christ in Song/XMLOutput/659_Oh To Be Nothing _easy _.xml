Only to lie at His feet
A broken and emptied vessel
For the Master's use made meet
Oh to be nothing nothing
Only to lie at His feet
A broken and emptied vessel
For the Master's use made meet{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh to be nothing nothing
Only to lie at His feet
A broken and emptied vessel
For the Master's use made meet
Emptied that He might fill me
As forth to His service I go
Broken that so unhinder'd
His life through me might flow{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh to be nothing nothing
Only as led by His hand
A messenger at His gateway
Only waiting for His command
Only an instrument ready
His praises to sound at His will
Willing should He not require me
In silence to wait on Him still{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh to be nothing nothing
Painful the humbling may be
Yet low in the dust I'd lay me
That the world might my Savior see
Rather be nothing nothing
To Him let their voices be raised
He is the fountain of blessing
He only is meet to be praised{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
