Through grace I'll win
The promised crown
Whate'er my cross may be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Am I a soldier of the cross
A follow'r of the Lamb
And shall I fear to own His cause
Or blush to speak His name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Must I be carried to the skies
On flow'ry beds of ease
While others fought to win the prize
And sailed thro' bloody seas{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Are there no foes for me to face
Must I not stem the flood
Is this vile world a friend to grace

Increase my courage Lord
I'll bear the toil endure the pain
Supported by Thy word{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
