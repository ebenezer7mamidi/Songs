Is more than all the world to me:
’Tis higher than the heights above,
And deeper than the soundless sea;
So old, so new,
So strong, so true;
Before the earth received its frame,
He loved me—Blessed be His name!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He held the highest place above,
Adored by all the sons of flame,
Yet such His self-denying love,
He laid aside His crown and came
To seek the lost,
And at the cost
Of heavenly rank and earthly fame
He sought me—Blessed be His name!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}It was a lonely path He trod,
From every human soul apart;
Known only to Himself and God
Was all the grief that filled His heart,
Yet from the track
He turned not back,
Till where I lay in want and shame,
He found me—Blessed be His name!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Then dawned at last that day of dread,
When desolate, yet undismayed,
With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,
He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,
Was then made sin
On Calvary,
And, dying there in grief and shame,
He saved me—Blessed be His name!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Long as I live my song shall tell
The wonders of His dying love;
And when at last I go to dwell
With Him His sovereign grace to prove,
My joy shall be
His face to see,
And bowing there with loud acclaim
I’ll praise Him—Blessed be His name!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
