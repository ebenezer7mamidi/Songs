Oft checked in bitter tears
What lesson hast thou here to learn
From all those thirty years
Behold the perfect Man
God's purpose full in view
Thus waiting hidden and unknown
With such a work to do{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He knowing well the plan
Hastes not to tread the road
But waits in patience for the sign
Dependent upon God
Lesson of priceless worth
Those thirty silent years
Rebuke to nature's anxious zeal
Its haste its restless fears{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}No rash unchastened zeal
Pressing to do His will
The heart that knows His guiding
Awaits it and is still
O wondrous thirty years
Thus teach my restless heart
If 'tis so blest to work for Him
Blest too the waiting part{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}How sweet the quiet trust
Those secret times with God
Though friends around misunderstand
Though Satan stalk abroad
The heart in untouched calm
With Him waits patiently
O lesson of those thirty years
I thank my God for Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
