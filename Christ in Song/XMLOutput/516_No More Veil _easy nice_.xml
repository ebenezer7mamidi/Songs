God bids me enter
By the new and living way --
Not in trembling hope I venture,
Boldly I His call obey:
There, with Him, my God I meet,
God upon the mercy seat!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}In the robes of spotless whiteness,
With the blood of priceless worth,
He has gone into that brightness,
Christ rejected from the earth --
Christ accepted there on high,
And in Him do I draw nigh.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, the welcome I have found there,
God in all His love made known!
Oh, the glories that surround there,
Those accepted in His Son!
Who can tell the depth of bliss
Spoken by the Father's kiss?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}One with Him, O Lord, before Thee,
There I live, and yet not I;
Christ it is who there adores Thee:
Who more dear, or who more nigh?
All the Father's heart mine own --
Mine and yet His Son's alone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}All the worth I have before Him
Is the value of the Blood;
I present when I adore Him,
Christ the first-fruits unto God;
Him with joy doth God behold,
Thus is my acceptance told.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
