Because He first loved me,
And purchased my salvation on Calv’ry’s tree.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Gone from my heart the world and all its charms;
Now through the blood I’m saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross my heart is bending low;
The precious blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Once I was lost, and fallen deep in sin;
Once was a slave to passions fierce within;
Once was afraid to meet an angry God,
But now I’m cleansed from every stain thro’ Jesus’ blood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Once I was bound, but now I am set free;
Once I was blind, but now the light I see;
Once I was dead, but now in Christ I live,
To tell the world around the peace that He doth give.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
