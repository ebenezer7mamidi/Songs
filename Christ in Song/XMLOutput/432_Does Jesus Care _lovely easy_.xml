I know He cares
His heart is touched
With my grief
When the days are weary
The long nights dreary
I know my Savior cares{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Does Jesus care
When my heart is pained
Too deeply for mirth and song
As the burdens press
And the cares distress
And the way grows
Weary and long{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Does Jesus care
When my way is dark
With a nameless dread and fear
As the daylight fades
Into deep night shades
Does He care enough to be near{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Does Jesus care
When I've tried and failed
To resist some temptation strong
When for my deep grief
There is no relief
Tho' my tears flow
All the night long{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Does Jesus care
When I've said goodbye
To the dearest on earth to me
And my sad heart aches
Till it nearly breaks
Is it aught to Him
Does He see{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
