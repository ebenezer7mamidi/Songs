Not mine to fear but to obey
With such a leader who could quail
Thou art as Thou wert yesterday
Strength of my heart
I rest in Thee
Fulfill Thy purposes through me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Hope of my heart though suns burn low
And fades the green from all the earth
Thy quenchless hope would fervent glow
From barren waste would spring to birth
Hope of my heart oh cause to be
Renewals of Thy hope in me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Love of my heart my streams run dry
O Fountain of the heavenly hills
Love blessed Love to Thee I cry
Flood all my secret hidden rills
Waters of love oh pour through me
I must have love
I must have Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord give me love then I have all
For love casts out tormenting fear
And love sounds forth a trumpet call
To valiant hope and sweet and clear
The birds of joy sing in my tree
Love of my heart when I have Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
