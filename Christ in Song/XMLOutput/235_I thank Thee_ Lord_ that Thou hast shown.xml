And I begin to see,
What Thou canst be to all Thine own,
What they may be to Thee;
If only they will yield Thee all,
And trustingly obey Thy call.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}How wonderful! I never knew
That I might trust Thee so;
That Thou wouldst be so much to me.
In all the way I go,
That every need Thou wouldst supply.
And all my longings satisfy.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I take Thee as my keeper now
And I commit to Thee
My soul, my way, my works, my cause.
In Thy sole charge to be;
And my deposit, Thou, I know
Wilt guard secure from every foe.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I take Thee for my peace, O Lord.
My heart to keep and fill
Thine own great calm, amid earth’s storms
Shall keep me always still;
And as Thy kingdom doth increase,
So shall Thine ever-deep’ning peace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I take Thee as my wisdom too
For wisdom’s sum Thou art;
Thou, who dost choose the foolish things.
Set me henceforth apart,
That I may speak and work for Thee
As Thou shalt work and speak in me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}I take Thee, Lord, to be my all.
Since all Thou art is mine;
I nothing have, and nothing am;
That nothing, Lord, is Thine.
Thou shalt be everything to me
In all things my sufficiency.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
