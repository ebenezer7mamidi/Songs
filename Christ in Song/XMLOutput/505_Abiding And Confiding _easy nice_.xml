And confiding in His word
I am hiding in the bosom of His love
Yes abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word
I am hiding in the bosom of His love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I have learned the wondrous secret
Of abiding in the Lord
I have tasted life's pure fountain
I am drinking of His word
I have found the strength and sweetness
Of abiding 'neath the blood
I have lost myself in Jesus
I am sinking into God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I am crucified with Jesus
And He lives and dwells with me
I have ceased from all my struggling
'Tis no longer I but He
All my will is yielding to Him
And His Spirit reigns within
And His precious blood each moment
Keeps me cleansed and free from sin{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}All my sicknesses I bring Him
And He bears them all away
All my fears and griefs I tell Him
All my cares from day to day
All my strength I draw from Jesus
By His breath I live and move
E'en His very mind He gives me
And His faith and life and love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}For my words I take His wisdom
For my works His Spirit's power
For my ways His ceaseless presence
Guards and guides me every hour
Of my heart He is the portion
Of my joy the boundless spring
Savior Sanctifier Healer
Glorious Lord and coming King{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
