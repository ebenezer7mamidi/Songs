Neutral you cannot be
Someday your heart will be asking
What will He do with me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus is standing in Pilate's hall
Friendless forsaken betrayed by all
Harken what meaneth the sudden call
What will you do with Jesus{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus is standing on trial still
You can be false to Him if you will
You can be faithful through good or ill
What will you do with Jesus{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Will you evade Him as Pilate tried
Or will you choose Him whate'er betide
Vainly you struggle from Him to hide
What will you do with Jesus{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Will you like Peter your Lord deny
Or will you scorn from His foes to fly

Jesus I'll follow Thee all the way
Gladly obeying Thee will you say
This will I do with Jesus{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
