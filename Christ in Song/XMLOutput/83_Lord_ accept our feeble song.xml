Pow’r and praise to Thee belong;
We would all Thy grace record,
Holy, gracious, loving Lord!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Rich in glory, Thou didst stoop,
Thence is all Thy people’s hope;
Thou wast poor, that we might be
Rich in glory, Lord, with Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Wherefore Thou high heaven didst spurn?
Wherefore Thou to earth didst turn?
Why leave heav’n to come to earth
Lonely, scorned, e’en suffering death?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou in heav’n—the glorious One!
Thou on earth—the outcast Man!
Though this suffering Thou didst know,
Love would come to bear our woe.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}When we think of love like this,
Joy and shame our hearts possess;
Joy, that Thou couldst pity thus;
Shame, for such returns from us.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Yet we hope the day to see
When from every hindrance free,
When to Thee, in glory, brought,
We shall serve Thee as we ought.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Now, O Lord, we wait for Thee,
Wait “the blessed hope” to see.
May we ever for Thee live,
Till Thy saints Thou dost receive.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
