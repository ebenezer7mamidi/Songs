His grace has no measure
His pow'r has no boundary
Known to men
For out of His infinite
Riches in Jesus
He giveth and giveth
And giveth again{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}He giveth more grace
When the burden grows greater
He sendeth more strength
When the labors increase
To added affliction
He addeth His mercy
To multiplied trials
His multiplied peace{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When we have exhausted
Our store of endurance
When our strength has failed
Ere the day is half done
When we reach the end
Of our hoarded resources
Our Father's full giving
Is only begun{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
