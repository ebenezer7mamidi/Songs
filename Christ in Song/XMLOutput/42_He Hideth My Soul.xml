That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand,
And covers me there with His hand.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful Savior to me;
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away;
He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
And, filled with His fulness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,
For such a Redeemer as mine!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
Iâ€™ll shout with the millions on high.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
