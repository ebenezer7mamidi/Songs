when has sunk yon glaring sun,
when we stand with Christ on high
looking o'er life's history,
then, Lord, shall I fully know,
not till then, how much I owe.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When I stand before the throne,
dressed in beauty not my own,
when I see thee as thou art,
love thee with unsinning heart,
then, Lord, shall I fully know,
not till then, how much I owe.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When the praise of heav'n I hear,
loud as thunders to the ear,
loud as many waters' noise,
sweet as harp's melodious voice,
then, Lord, shall I fully know,
not till then, how much I owe.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}E'en on earth, as through a glass
Darkly, let Thy glory pass,
Make forgiveness feel so sweet,
Make Thy Spirit’s help so meet,
E'en on earth, Lord, make me know
Something of how much I owe.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}When in flowery paths I tread,
Oft by sin I’m captive led;
Oft I fall—but still arise—
The Spirit comes—the tempter flies;
Blessed Spirit! bid me show
Weary sinners all I owe.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Chosen not for good in me,
Wakened up from wrath to flee,
Hidden in the Savior’s side,
By the Spirit sanctified,
Teach me, Lord, on earth to show,
By my love, how much I owe.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
