Doth his successive journeys run;
His Kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}To Him shall endless prayer be made.
And princes throng to crown His head,
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
With every morning sacrifice.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song;
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His name.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Blessings abound where’er He reigns:
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains,
The weary find eternal rest,
And all the sons of want are blest.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Where He displays His healing power
Death and the curse are known no more;
In Him the tribes of Adam boast
More blessings than their father lost.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Let every creature rise and bring
Peculiar honors to our King;
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud Amen.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
