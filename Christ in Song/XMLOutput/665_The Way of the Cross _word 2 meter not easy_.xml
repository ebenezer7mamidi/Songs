What does bearing the Cross mean to you
You who've given yourself
Your all to God
To God are you wholly true{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}The way of the Cross means sacrifice
As to God you yield your all
To be laid on the altar the place of death
Where fire will surely fall{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}As the voice of song and prayer we raise
How easy to say we give all
Till some rougher cross lies just before
And sterner is duty's call{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Do you falter then or true to death
Just die on the cross in the way
Til the fullness of life
From the Living One
Is filling you day by day{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Tis the plan of life for you to die to live
One with Jesus crucified
With the life alone to be lived through you
Of the Risen the Glorified{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
