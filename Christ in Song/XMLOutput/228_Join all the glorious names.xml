Of wisdom, love, and pow’r,
That mortals ever knew,
That angels ever bore;
All are too mean to speak His worth,
Too mean to set my Savior forth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Great Prophet of my God,
My tongue would bless Thy name;
By Thee the joyful news
Of our salvation came;
The joyful news of sins forgiv’n,
Of death annulled, and Thy life giv’n.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus, my great High Priest,
Offered His blood, and died;
My guilty conscience seeks
No sacrifice beside:
His pow’rful blood did me redeem,
’Tis worthy of my heart’s esteem.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I love my Shepherd’s voice:
His watchful eye shall keep
My wand’ring soul among
The thousands of His sheep:
He feeds His flock, He calls their names,
His bosom bears the tender lambs.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}My Savior and my Lord,
My Conqu’ror and my King,
Thy scepter and Thy sword,
Thy reigning grace I sing:
Thine is the pow’r; behold I sit
In willing bonds beneath Thy feet.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
