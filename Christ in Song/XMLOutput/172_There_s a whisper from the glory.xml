Glory, glory! Hallelujah!
Glory, glory! Hallelujah!
The King is coming soon!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}There’s a whisper from the glory of the coming of the Lord!
Oh, the joy my heart is tasting as I rest upon His Word,
And what peace amid earth’s tumult doth this precious truth afford,—
Hold fast! I'm coming soon!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}In the glory of His promise I am living day by day,
And the light of Heav’n is dawning on earth’s dreary, desert way,
While I wait that sweetest whisper, “Up, my child, and come away,”—
The King is coming soon!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}What matters is the tumult of the world with sorrow rife?
For the conflict now is ending and the glorious Prince of Life
Will present His shining laurels to the victors o’er the strife,—
The King is coming soon!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}There’s a glory on the mountains and a glory on the sea,
And the valleys now are glowing and the desert way can be
Just a pilgrimage to glory since He whispered it to me—
Hold fast! I'm coming soon!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
