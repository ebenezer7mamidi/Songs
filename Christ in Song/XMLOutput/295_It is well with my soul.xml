With my soul (With my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}When peace like a river attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say,
“It is well, it is well with my soul!”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}My sin—oh, the bliss of this glorious thought—
My sin, not in part, but the whole,
Is nailed to His Cross, and I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live;
If dark hours about me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}But, Lord, ’tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
