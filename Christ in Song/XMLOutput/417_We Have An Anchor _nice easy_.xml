That keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure
While the billows roll
Fastened to the Rock
Which cannot move
Grounded firm and deep
In the Savior's love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Will your anchor hold
In the storms of life
When the clouds unfold
Their wings of strife
When the strong tides lift
And the cables strain
Will your anchor drift
Or firm remain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It is safely moored
'twill the storm withstand
For 'tis well secured
By the Savior's hand
And the cables passed
From His heart to mine
Can defy the blast
Through strength divine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}It will firmly hold
in the straits of fear
When the breakers
Have told the reef is near
Though the tempest rave
And the wild winds blow
Not an angry wave
Shall our bark o'erflow{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}It will surely hold
in the floods of death
When the waters cold
Chill our latest breath
On the rising tide
It can never fail
While our hopes abide
Within the veil{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}When our eyes behold
Through the glaring night
The city of gold
Our harbor bright
We shall anchor fast
By the heavenly shore
With the storms all past
For evermore{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
