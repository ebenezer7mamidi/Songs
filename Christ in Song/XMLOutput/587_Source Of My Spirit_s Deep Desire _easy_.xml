Deep desire
For living joys that
Shall not perish
The patient hope
Thy words inspire
Still let Thy tender
Mercy cherish{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}On Thee my humbled
Soul would wait
Her utmost weakness
Calmly learning
And see Thy grace its
Way create
Through thorns and briers
Which Thou art burning{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Gladly my inmost
Heart would know
The love that now it
Faintly traces
And see the streams from
Zion flow
O'er all its waste
And desert places{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}And still I hope
O not in vain
I know this holy
Seed possessing
Thou wilt come down
Like gentle rain
And make the barren
Ground a blessing{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
