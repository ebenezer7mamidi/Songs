Zion city of our God
He whose word cannot be broken
Formed thee for His own abode
On the Rock of Ages founded
What can shake thy sure repose
With salvation's walls surrounded
Thou may'st smile at all thy foes{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}See the streams of living waters
Springing from eternal love
Well supply thy sons and daughters
And all fear of want remove
Who can faint while such a river
Ever flows their thirst t'assuage
Grace which like the Lord the Giver
Never fails from age to age{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Blest inhabitants of Zion
Washed in the Redeemer's blood
Jesus whom their souls rely on
Makes them kings and priests to God
'Tis His love His people raises
Over self to reign as kings
And as priests His solemn praises
Each his thankful offering brings{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Savior since of Zion's city
I thro' grace a member am
Let the world deride or pity
I will glory in Thy name
Fading is the worldling's pleasure
All its boasted pomp and show
Solid joys and lasting treasures
None but Zion's children know{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
