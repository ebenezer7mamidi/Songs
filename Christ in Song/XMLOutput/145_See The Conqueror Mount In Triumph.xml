See The King In Royal State
Riding On The Clouds His Chariot
To His Heavenly Palace Gate;
Hark, The Choirs Of Angel-Voices
Joyful Hallelujahs Sing,
And The Portals High Are Lifted
To Receive Their Heavenly King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Who Is This That Comes In Glory,
With The Trump Of Jubilee?
Lord Of Battles, God Of Armies,
He Has Gained The Victory;
He Who On The Cross Did Suffer,
He Who From The Grave Arose,
He Has Vanquished Sin And Satan,
He By Death Has Spoiled His Foes.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}While He Lifts His Hands In Blessing,
He Is Parted From His Friends;
While Their Eager Eyes Behold Him,
He Upon The Clouds Ascends;
He Who Walked With God, And Pleased Him,
Preaching Truth And Doom To Come,
He, Our Enoch, Is Translated
To His Everlasting Home.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Now Our Heavenly Aaron Enters,
With His Blood, Within The Veil;
Joshua Now Is Come To Canaan,
And The Kings Before Him Quail;
Now He Plants The Tribes Of Israel
In Their Promised Resting-Place;
Now Our Great Elijah Offers
Double Portion Of His Grace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}He Has Raised Our Human Nature
On The Clouds To Godâ€™s Right Hand;
There We Sit In Heavenly Places,
There With Him In Glory Stand:
Jesus Reigns, Adored By Angels;
Man With God Is On The Throne;
Mighty Lord, In Thine Ascension
We By Faith Behold Our Own.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
