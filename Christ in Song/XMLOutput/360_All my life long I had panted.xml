I have found Him
Whom my soul so long has craved!
Jesus satisfies my longings;
Through His life I now am saved.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}All my life long I had panted
For a draught from some cool spring,
That I hoped would quench the burning
Of the thirst I felt within.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Feeding on the husks around me,
Till my strength was almost gone,
Longed my soul for something better,
Only still to hunger on.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Poor I was, and sought for riches,
Something that would satisfy,
But the dust I gathered round me
Only mocked my soulâ€™s sad cry.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Well of water, ever springing,
Bread of life, so rich and free,
Untold wealth that never faileth,
My Redeemer is to me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
