When we the path retrace
Which Thou on earth hast trod,
To men Thy wondrous love and grace,
Thy faithfulness to God;{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy love, by man so sorely tried,
Proved stronger than the grave;
The very spear that pierced Thy side
Drew forth the blood to save;{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Though Thou didst pass through woes and grief,
Thy works were ever good;
Although midst sorrows all Thy life,
Thou spak’st no murmuring word.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,
’Mid darkness only light,
Thou didst Thy Father’s name confess,
And in His will delight;{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Unmoved by Satan’s subtle wiles,
Or suffering, shame, and loss,
Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles,
Led only to the cross.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}O Lord, with sorrow and with shame,
We meekly would confess,
How little we, who bear Thy Name,
Thy mind, Thy ways express.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}We wonder at Thy lowly mind,
And fain would like Thee be,
And all our rest and pleasure find
In learning, Lord, of Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
