We whose hearts on God are set
Babe-like souls of Jesus learning
While our cheeks with tears are wet
For the manger and the stable
Are not pleasant to our eyes
But our feet must follow Jesus
If our hands would grasp the prize{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Via Nazareth the pathway
Narrows still as on we go
Years of toil none understanding
Yet God teaches us to know
That the servant is not greater
Than the lord, who thro' long years
Hid Himself from this world's glory
Follow Him. Count not the tears{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Via Galilee, we see Him
Stones are hurled and curses hissed
By the men who gather round Him
Has He not the pathway missed
No - unharmed the Savior passes
And this rough bit of the way
We must travel since like Jesus
Nothing can our purpose stay{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Via too the awful anguish
Of the hours beneath the trees
Where the hosts of Satan linger
Awful hours of anguish these
Yet we fail not for God's angels
Minister to us and say
"Look, beloved at the glory
Conflict is but for a day!"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Then the Cross for via Calvary
Every royal soul must go
Here we draw the veil
For Jesus only can the pathway show
"If we suffer with Him" Listen
Just a little, little while
And the memory will have faded
In the glory of His smile{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Then the grave with dear ones weeping
Knowing that all life has fled
(Fellow-pilgrims art thou numbered
With the men the world calls dead?)
Thence we rise and live with Jesus
Throned above the world's mad strife
Gladly forfeiting forever
All that worldlings count as life{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}On we press and yonder gleaming
Nearing every day we see
The great walls of that fair city
God has built for such as we
And we catch the tender music
Of the choirs that sing of One
Who once died to have us with Him
In His kingdom on the throne{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Just a few more miles beloved
And our feet shall ache no more
No more sin, and no more sorrow
Hush thee Jesus went before
And I hear Him sweetly whispering
Faint not fear not still press on
For it may be ere tomorrow
The long Journey will be done{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
