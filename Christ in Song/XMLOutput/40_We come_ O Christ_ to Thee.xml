True Son of God and man,
By whom all things consist,
In whom all life began:
In Thee alone we live and move
And have our being in Thy love.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou art the Way to God,
Thy blood our ransom paid;
In Thee we face our Judge
And Maker unafraid.
Before the Throne absolved we stand:
Thy love has met Thy law’s demand.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou art the living Truth!
All wisdom dwells in Thee,
Thou Source of every skill,

True answer to our every quest.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou only art true Life,

And Thou in us eternally!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}We worship Thee Lord Christ,
Our Savior and our King,
To Thee our youth and strength
Adoringly we bring:
So fill our hearts that men may see
Thy life in us and turn to Thee!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
