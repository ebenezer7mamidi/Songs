Whose height - Whose depth
Unfathomed no man knows
I see from far Thy beauteous light
I sigh for Thy repose
My heart is pained nor can it be
At rest till it finds rest in Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy secret voice invites me still
The sweetness of Thy yoke to prove
And fain I would but though my will
Seems fixed yet wide my passions rove
Yet hindrances strew all the way
I aim at Thee yet from Thee stray{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}'Tis mercy all that Thou hast brought
My mind to seek her peace in Thee
Yet while I seek but find Thee not
No peace my wand'ring soul shall see
Oh when shall all my wand'rings end
And all my steps to Thee-ward tend{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Is there a thing beneath the sun
That strives with Thee my heart to share
Ah tear it thence and reign alone
The Lord of every motion there
Then shall my heart from earth be free
When it has found repose in Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh hide this self from me that I
No more but Christ in me may live
My vile affections mortify
Nor let one darling sin survive
In all things nothing may I see
Nothing desire or seek but Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}O Lord Thy sovereign aid impart
To save me from low-thoughted care
Chase this self-will through all my heart
Through all its latent mazes there
Make me Thy duteous child that I
Ceaseless may Abba Father cry{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Each moment draw from earth away
My heart which lowly waits Thy call
Speak to my inmost soul and say
"I am Thy Love - Thy God - Thy all"
To feel Thy power to hear Thy voice
To taste Thy love be all my choice{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
