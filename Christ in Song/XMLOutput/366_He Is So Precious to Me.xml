For He is so precious to me; (so precious to me;)
'Tis heaven below, my Redeemer to know,
For He is so precious to me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}So precious is Jesus, my Savior, my King,
His praise all the day long with rapture I sing;
To Him in my weakness for strength I can cling,
For He is so precious to me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He stood at my heart's door in sunshine and rain
And patiently waited an entrance to gain;
What shame that so long He entreated in vain,
For He is so precious to me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I stand on the mountain of blessing at last,
No cloud in the heavens a shadow to cast;
His smile is upon me, the valley is past,
For He is so precious to me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I praise Him because He appointed a place
Where, someday, through faith in His wonderful grace,
I know I shall see Him, shall look on His face,
For He is so precious to me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
