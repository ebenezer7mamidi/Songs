I daily, hourly sing;
My heart is at the secret source
Of every precious thing.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}My heart is resting, O my God,
I will give thanks and sing;
My heart is at the secret source
Of every precious thing.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Now this frail vessel Thou hast made,
No hand but Thine shall fill;
The waters of the earth have failed,
And I am thirsty still.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I thirst for springs of heavenly life,
And here all day they rise;
I seek the treasure of Thy love,
And close at hand it lies.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}A glad, new song is in my mouth,
To long-loved music set,
A song of praise for all the grace
I have not tasted yet.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I have a heritage of joy
That yet I must not see;
The hand that bled to make it mine
Is keeping it for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}There is a certainty of love
That sets my heart at rest;
A calm assurance for today
That to be poor is best.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}A prayer reposing on His truth,
Who hath made all things mine;
That draws my captive will to Him,
And makes it one with Thine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
