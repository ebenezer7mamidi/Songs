Be this belov'd thy portion
Within the secret
Of thy Lord to dwell
Beholding Him
Until thy face His glory
Thy life His love
Thy lips His praise shall tell{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}"Within the Veil"
For only as thou gazest
Upon the matchless
Beauty of His face
Canst thou become
A living revelation
Of His great heart of love
His untold grace{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}"Within the Veil"
His fragrance poured upon thee
Without the Veil
That fragrance shed abroad
"Within the Veil"
His hand shall tune the music
Which sounds on earth
The praises of Thy Lord{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}"Within the Veil"
Thy spirit deeply anchored
Thou walkest calm
Above a world of strife
"Within the Veil"
Thy soul with Him united
Shall live on earth
His resurrection life{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
