How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When through the woods, and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And then proclaim, "My God, how great Thou art"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
