Some thru the flood
Some thru the fire
But all thru the blood
Some thru great sorrow
But God gives a song
In the night season
And all the day long{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}In shady green pastures
So rich and so sweet
God leads
His dear children along
Where the water's cool flow
Bathes the weary one's feet
God leads
His dear children along{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Sometimes on the mount
Where the sun shines so bright
God leads
His dear children along
Sometimes in the valley
In darkest of night
God leads
His dear children along{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Tho sorrows befall us
And Satan oppose
God leads
His dear children along
Through grace we can conquer
Defeat all our foes
God leads
His dear children along{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Away from the mire
And away from the clay
God leads
His dear children along
Away up in glory
Eternity's day
God leads
His dear children along{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
