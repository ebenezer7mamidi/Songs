Shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding Sacrifice
In my behalf appears.
Before the throne my Surety stands;
My name is written on His hands.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He ever lives above
For me to intercede,
His all-redeeming love,
His precious blood to plead.
His blood was shed for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Five bleeding wounds He bears,
Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers;
They strongly speak for me.
Forgive him, O forgive, they cry,
Nor let that ransomed sinner die!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}The Father hears Him pray,
His dear anointed One;
He cannot turn away
The presence of His Son.
His Spirit answers to the blood,
And tells me I am born of God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}My God is reconciled,
His pardoning voice I hear;
He owns me for His child,
I can no longer fear.
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And Father, Abba, Father, cry.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
