Thy holy, blest eternal Son;
The Nazarene, the Crucified,
Now sits exalted on Thy throne:
To Him in faith we cry aloud,
Worthy art Thou, O Lamb of God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Father, Thy holy name we bless,
And gladly hail Thy just decree
That every tongue shall soon confess
Jesus the Lord of all to be;
But oh, Thy grace has taught us now
Before that Lord the knee to bow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Him as our Lord we gladly own:
To Him alone we now would live,
Who bowed our hearts
before Thy throne,
And gave us all that love could give.
Our willing voices cry aloud,
Worthy art Thou, O Lamb of God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
