shall break every chain,
And give us the vict’ry,
again and again.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}‘Twas Jesus, my Saviour,
who died on the tree,
To open a fountain
for sinners like me;
His blood is that fountain
which pardon bestows,
And cleanses the foulest
wherever it flows.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}And when I was willing
with all things to part,
He gave me His blessing,
His love in my heart;
So now I am joined
with the conquering band
Who are marching
to glory at Jesus’ command.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Though round me the storms
of adversity roll,
And the waves of destruction
encompass my soul;
In vain this frail vessel
the tempest shall toss—
My hope is secure
through the blood of the cross.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}And when with the ransomed,
by Jesus, my Head,
From fountain to fountain
I then shall be led;
I’ll fall at His feet
and His mercy adore,
And sing Hallelujah
to God evermore.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
