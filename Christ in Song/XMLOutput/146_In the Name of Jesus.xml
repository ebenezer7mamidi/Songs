Every knee shall bow,
Every tongue confess Him
King of glory now;
’Tis the Father’s pleasure
We should call Him Lord,
Who from the beginning
Was the Mighty Word.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}At His voice creation
Sprang at once to sight:
All the angel faces,
All the hosts of light,
Thrones and dominations,
Stars upon their way,
All the heav’nly orders,
In their great array.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Humbled for a season,
To receive a Name
From the lips of sinners
Unto whom He came,
Faithfully He bore it
Spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious,
When from death He passed;{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Bore it up triumphant,
With its human light,
Through all ranks of creatures,
To the central height;
To the throne of Godhead,
To the Father’s breast,
Filled it with the glory
Of that perfect rest.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Name Him, brothers, name Him,
With love strong as death,
But with awe and wonder,
And with bated breath;
He is God the Savior,
He is Christ the Lord,
Ever to be worshiped,
Trusted, and adored.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}In your hearts enthrone Him;
There let Him subdue
All that is not holy,
All that is not true;
Crown Him as your Captain
In temptation’s hour;
Let His will enfold you
In its light and power.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Brothers, this Lord Jesus
Shall return again,
With His Father’s glory,
With His angel train;
For all wreaths of empire
Meet upon His brow,
And our hearts confess Him
King of glory now.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
