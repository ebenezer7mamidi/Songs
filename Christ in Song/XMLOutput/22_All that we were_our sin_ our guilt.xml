Our death—was all our own:
All that we are we owe to Thee,
Thou God of grace alone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy mercy found us in our sins,
And gave us to believe;
Then, in believing, peace we found,
And in Thy Christ we live.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}All that we are, as saints on earth,
All that we hope to be,
When Jesus comes and glory dawns,
We owe it all to Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O God, how rich, how vast Thy love,
Whoe’er can Thee repay?
Thy love is past man’s finding out,
Thy grace no man can say.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}But Lord, to me I pray Thee grant,
More clearly may I see,
That I may e’er more fully know
How much I owe to Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}But if man’s heart should e’er suppose
He could repay Thy love,
It only means he nothing knows
Of love, all loves above.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}So may we never bargains make
With that dear love of Thine:
The love that made Thine heart once break,
Whoe’er that love could win?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Then nevermore suggest return,
His love is far too high;
But let our hearts with rapture burn
That He for us should die.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v9"><lines>{lang-eng}O Father God, we owe Thee all!
All that we are and have!
With grateful thanks before Thee fall,
’Tis all that we can give.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
