Grace Of Jesus,
Deeper Than The Mighty Rolling Sea,
Higher Than The Mountain,
Sparkling Like A Fountain,
All Sufficient Grace For Even Me;
Broader Than The Scope
Of My Transgressions,
Greater Far Than All My Sin And Shame;
O Magnify The Precious Name Of Jesus,
Praise His Name!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Wonderful Grace Of Jesus,
Greater Than All My Sin;
How Shall My Tongue Describe It,
Where Shall Its Praise Begin?
Taking Away My Burden, Setting My Spirit Free,
For The Wonderful Grace Of Jesus Reaches Me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Wonderful Grace Of Jesus,
Reaching To All The Lost,
By It I Have Been Pardoned,
Saved To The Uttermost;
Chains Have Been Torn Asunder, Giving Me Liberty,
For The Wonderful Grace Of Jesus Reaches Me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Wonderful Grace Of Jesus,
Reaching The Most Defiled,
By Its Transforming Power
Making Him Godâ€™s Dear Child;
Purchasing Peace And Heaven For All Eternity;
For The Wonderful Grace Of Jesus Reaches Me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
