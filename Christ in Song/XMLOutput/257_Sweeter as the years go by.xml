Sweeter as the years go by;
Richer, fuller, deeper,
Jesus’ love is sweeter,
Sweeter as the years go by.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Of Jesus’ love that sought me,
When I was lost in sin;
Of wondrous grace that brought me
Back to His fold again;
Of heights and depths of mercy,
Far deeper than the sea,
And higher than the heavens,
My theme shall ever be.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He trod in old Judea
Life’s pathway long ago;
The people thronged about Him,
His saving grace to know.
He healed the broken-hearted,
And caused the blind to see;
And still His great heart yearneth
In love for even me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}’Twas wondrous love which led Him
For us to suffer loss-
To bear without a murmur
The anguish of the cross;
With saints redeemed in glory,
Let us our voices raise,
Till Heav’n and earth re-echo
With our Redeemer’s praise.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
