A calm and heav'nly frame
A light to shine upon the road
That leads me to the Lamb{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Where is the blessedness I knew
When first I saw the Lord
Where is the soul-refreshing view

Help me to tear it from Thy throne
And worship only Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}So shall my walk be close with God
Calm and serene my frame
So purer light shall mark the road
That leads me to the Lamb{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
