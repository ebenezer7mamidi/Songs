In all my hours of waking thought
Not let this heart e'er wish to flee
Or think or feel where Thou art not{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}In every hour of pain and woe
When nought on earth this heart can cheer
When sighs will burst this heart can cheer
Lord hush the sigh and chase the tear{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In every dream of earthly bliss
Do Thou dear Jesus present be
Nor let a thought of happiness
On earth intrude apart from Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}To my last lingering thought at night

In still small accents wake mine ear{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Whene'er I read Thy sacred word

In every hour of waking thought
Nor let me ever wish to be
Or think or feel where Thou art not{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
