When shall I find my willing heart
All taken up by Thee?
My thirsty spirit faints to prove
The greatness of redeeming love,
The love of Christ to me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Stronger His love than death and hell,
Its riches are unsearchable:
The first-born sons of light
Desire in vain its depths to see;
They cannot reach the mystery,
The length, and breadth, and height.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}God only knows the love of God;
Oh, that it now were shed abroad
In this poor stony heart;
For love I sigh, for love I pine;
This only portion, Lord, be mine,
Be mine this better part.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, that I could forever sit
Like Mary, at the Master’s feet;
Be this my happy choice;
My only care, delight, and bliss,
My joy, my rest on earth be this,
To hear the Bridegroom’s voice.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}O that I could, with favored John,
Recline my weary head upon
The dear Redeemer’s breast!
From care, and sin, and sorrow free,
Give me, O Lord, to find in Thee
My everlasting rest.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
