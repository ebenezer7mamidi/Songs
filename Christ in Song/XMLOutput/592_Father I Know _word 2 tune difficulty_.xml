Is portioned out for me
The changes that will surely come
I do not fear to see
I ask Thee for a present mind
Intent on pleasing Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I ask Thee for a thoughtful love
Through constant watching wise
To meet the glad with joyful smiles
To wipe the weeping eyes
A heart at leisure from itself
To soothe and sympathize{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I would not have the restless will
That hurries to and fro
Seeking for some great thing to do
Or secret thing to know
I would be treated as a child
And guided where I go{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Wherever in the world I am
In what-soe'er estate
I have a fellowship with hearts
To keep and cultivate
A work of lowly love to do
For Him on whom I wait{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I ask Thee for the daily strength
To none that ask denied
A mind to blend with outward life
While keeping at Thy side
Content to fill a little space
If Thou be glorified{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}On every path there is untruth
That I might patient be
In every way there is a cross
That I might lean on Thee
A lowly heart will find each place
A paradise for me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}And if some things I ask not in
My cup of blessing be
I'd have my spirit filled the more
With grateful love to Thee
More careful-not to serve Thee much
But please Thee perfectly{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}In service which Thy will appoints
There are no bonds for me
My inmost heart is taught the truth
That makes Thy children free
A life of self-renouncing love
Is one of liberty{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
