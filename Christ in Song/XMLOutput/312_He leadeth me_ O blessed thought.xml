He leadeth me!
By His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful follower I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}He leadeth me! O blessed thought,
O words with heav’nly comfort fraught;
Whate’er I do, where’er I be,
Still ’tis Christ’s hand that leadeth me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Sometimes ’mid scenes of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom,
By waters still, o’er troubled sea,
Still ’tis His hand that leadeth me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur or repine;
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since it is Thou that leadest me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}And when my task on earth is done,
When, by Thy grace, the vict’ry’s won,
E’en death’s cold wave I will not flee,
Since Thou in triumph leadest me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
