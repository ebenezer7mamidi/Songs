My Savior, Jesus; yet this soul of mine
Would of Thy love in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
Know more and more.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine,
My Savior, Jesus; yet these lips of mine
Would fain proclaim to sinners, far and near,
A love which can remove all guilty fear,
And love beget.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,
My Savior, Jesus; yet this heart of mine
Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,
Which brings a rebel sinner, such as me,
Nigh unto God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}But though I cannot sing, or tell, or know
The fulness of Thy love, while here below,
My empty vessel I may freely bring;
O Thou, who art of love the living spring,
My vessel fill.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I am an empty vessel—not one thought
Or look of love to Thee I’ve ever brought;
Yet I may come, and come again to Thee,
With this the empty sinner’s only plea,
Thou lovest me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, fill me, Jesus, Savior, with Thy love!
Lead, lead me to the living fount above;
Thither may I, in simple faith draw nigh,
And never to another fountain fly,
But unto Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord Jesus, when Thee face to face I see,
When on Thy lofty throne I sit with Thee,
Then of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
My soul shall sing.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
