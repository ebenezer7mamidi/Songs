Seek alone in Jesus rest
Has he not your love excited
Then let love inspire each breast{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Members on our Head depending
Light reflecting Him our Sun
Brethren His commands attending
We in Him our Lord are one
Come then come O flock of Jesus
Covenant with Him anew
Unto Him who conquered for us
Pledge we love and service true
And should our love's union holy
Firmly linked no more remain
Wait ye at His footstool lowly
Till He draw it close again{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Grant Lord that with Thy direction
Love each other we comply
Aiming with unfeigned affection
Thy love to exemplify
Let our mutual love be glowing
Thus will all men plainly see
That we as on one stem growing
Living branches are in Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O that such may be our union
As Thine with The Father is
And not one of our communion
E'er forsake the path of bliss
May our light shine forth with brightness
From Thy light reflected shine
Thus the world will bear us witness
That we Lord are truly Thine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
