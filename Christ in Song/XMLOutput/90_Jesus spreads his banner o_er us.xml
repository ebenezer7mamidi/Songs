Cheers our famished souls with food;
He the banquet spreads before us,
Of His mystic flesh and blood.
Precious banquet, bread of heaven,
Wine of gladness, flowing free;
May we taste it, kindly given,
In remembrance, Lord, of Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}In Thy holy incarnation,
When the angels sang Thy birth;
In Thy fasting and temptation,
In Thy labors on the earth,
In Thy trial and rejection,
In Thy sufferings on the tree,
In Thy glorious resurrection,
May we, Lord, remember Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In Thy wondrous crucifixion
Shunned bt God, condemned by man,
Thou didst purchase our redemption,
Bridged in love the dreadful span.
Now to heav'n Thou hast ascended;
There for us to intercede;
Coming soon in glory splendid-
Blest remembrance, Lord, of Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
