What God hath willed, what God hath planned;
I only know at His right hand
Stands One who is my Savior.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I take Him at His word indeed:
“Christ died for sinners”—this I read;
For in my heart I find a need
Of Him to be my Savior!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}And was there then no other way
For God to take? - I cannot say;
I only bless Him, day by day,
Who saved me through my Saviour.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}That He should leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die,
You count it strange? So once did I
Before I knew my Savior!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}And, oh, that He fulfilled may see
The travail of His soul in me,
And with His work contented be,
As I with my dear Savior!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Yes, living, dying, let me bring
My strength, my solace from this spring—
That He who lives to be my King
Once died to be my Savior!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
