And then I shall be free
Force me to render up my sword
And I shall conqueror be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I sink in life's alarms
When by myself I stand
Imprison me within Thine arms
And strong shall be my hand
My heart is weak and poor
Until it master find
It has no spring of action sure
It varies with the wind
It cannot freely move
Till thou hast wrought its chain
Enslave it with Thy matchless love
And deathless it shall reign{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}My power is faint and low
Till I have learned to serve
It wants the needed fire to glow
It wants the breeze to nerve
It cannot drive the world
Until itself be driven
Its flag can only be unfurled
When Thou shalt breathe from heaven{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}My will is not my own
Till Thou hast made it Thine
If it would reach the monarch's throne
It must its crown resign
It only stands unbent
Amid the clashing strife
When on Thy bosom it has leant
And found in Thee its life{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
