Hail, Thou still rejected King!
Thou didst suffer to release us,
Thou didst free salvation bring;
Through Thy death and resurrection,
Bearer of our sin and shame!
We enjoy divine protection,
Life and glory through Thy name.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Paschal Lamb, by God appointed,
All our sins on Thee were laid;
By our Father’s love anointed,
Thou redemption’s price hast paid.
All who trust Thee are forgiven
Through the virtue of Thy blood;
Opened are the things of heaven,
Grace shines forth to man from God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus, hail! enthroned in glory,
Where for us Thou dost abide;
We, by faith, do now adore Thee,
Seated at Thy Father’s side.
There, for us Thou now art pleading,
There Thou dost our sorrows share,
Ever for us interceding,
Till in glory we appear.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Worship, honor, praise, and blessing,
Thou art worthy to receive;
Loudest praises, without ceasing,
Meet it is for us to give.
In that day Thy saints will meet Thee,
Welcome Thee with grateful song;
Joyful hearts will ever greet Thee,
Source of joy to all the throng!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
