And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share
as we tarry there
None other has ever known{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}I come to the garden alone
While the dew
is still on the roses
And the voice I hear
falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He speaks
And the sound of His voice
Is so sweet
The birds hush their singing
And the melody
That He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I'd stay in the garden with Him
Tho' the night
Around me be falling
But He bids me go
Thro' the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
