Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;
Finding joy and pleasure
In abounding measure,
I am drinking at the Fountain of life.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Many weary years I vainly sought a spring,
One that never would run dry;
Unavailing all that earth to me could bring,
Nothing seemed to satisfy.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Through the desert land of sin I roam no more,
For I find a living Spring
And my cup of gladness now is running oâ€™er,
Jesus is my Lord and King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Here is sweet contentment as the days go by,
Here is holy peace and rest;
Here is consolation as the moments fly,
Here my heart is always blest.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Here I find a never ending, sure supply,
While the endless ages roll;
To this healing Fountain I would ever fly,
There to bathe my weary soul.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
