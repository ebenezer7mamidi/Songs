So the Master wills
He speaketh let us hear
His gracious voice
Us with His holy life
He daily fills
So in that holiness
Let us rejoice{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}These bodies then are His
He doth them use
So let Him use them
As it seemeth good
These members all are His
Shall we abuse
For earthly vileness
Vessels cleansed with blood{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}These eyes are His - these ears
These lips - this tougue
They are all His far more
Than they are ours
Shall we pollute them with
Earth's sin and wrong
Or waste in vain delights
These God-given powers{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}These hands are His
Shall they not do His work
These feet are His
Let them His errands run
Shall in this frame
The foe of goodness lurk
Shall he usurp
The consecrated throne{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Upon His holy throne
These members yet
Shall all be seated
In that day when He
The head of the great unity
Shall sit
With them to share
One common royalty{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
