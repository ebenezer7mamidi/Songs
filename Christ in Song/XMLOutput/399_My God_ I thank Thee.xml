The earth so bright,
So full of splendor and of joy,
Beauty and light;
So many glorious things are here,
Noble and right.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I thank Thee, too, that Thou hast made
Joy to abound;
So many gentle thoughts and deeds
Circling us round,
That in the darkest spot of earth
Some love is found.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I thank Thee more that all our joy
Is touched with pain,
That shadows fall on brightest hours,
That thorns remain;
So that earth’s bliss may be our guide,
And not our chain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}For thou who knowest, Lord, how soon
Our weak heart clings,
Hast given us joys, tender and true,
Yet all with wings;
So that we see gleaming on high
Diviner things.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast kept
The best in store;
We have enough, yet not too much
To long for more:
A yearning for a deeper peace
Not known before.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}I thank Thee, Lord, that here our souls
Though amply blessed,
Can never find, although they seek
A perfect rest;
Nor ever shall, until they lean
On Jesus’ breast.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
