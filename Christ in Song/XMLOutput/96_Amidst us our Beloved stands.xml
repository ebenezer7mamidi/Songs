And bids us view His pierced hands;
Points to the wounded feet and side,
Blest emblems of the Crucified.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}What food luxurious loads the board
When, at His table, sits the Lord!
The wine how rich, the bread how sweet,
When Jesus deigns the guests to meet!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}If now, with eyes defiled and dim,
We see the signs, but see not Him;
Oh, may His love the scales displace,
And bid us see Him face to face!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou glorious Bridegroom of our hearts,
Thy present smile Thy grace imparts!
Oh, lift the veil, if veil there be,
Let every saint Thy glory see!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
