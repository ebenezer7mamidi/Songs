A kingly crown to gain
His blood-red banner streams afar
Who follows in His train
Who best can drink His cup of woe
Triumphant over pain
Who patient bears His cross below
He follows in His train{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The martyr first whose eagle eye
Could pierce beyond the grave
Who saw His Master in the sky
And called on Him to save
Like Him with pardon on His tongue
In midst of mortal pain
He prayed for them that did the wrong
Who follows in His train{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}A glorious band the chosen few
On whom the Spirit came
Twelve valiant saints their hope they knew
And mocked the cross and flame
They met the tyrant's brandished steel
The lion's gory mane
They bowed their necks the death to feel
Who follows in their train{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}A noble army men and boys
The matron and the maid
Around the Saviour's throne rejoice
In robes of light arrayed
They climbed the steep ascent of heaven
Through peril toil and pain
O God to us may grace be given
To follow in their train{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
