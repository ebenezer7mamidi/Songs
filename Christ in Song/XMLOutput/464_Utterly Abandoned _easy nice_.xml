To The Lord of all
Seeking all His fullness
Answering His dear call{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Utterly abandoned
To The Holy Ghost
Seeking all his fullness
At whatever cost
Cutting all the shore-lines
Launching in the deep
Of His mighty power
Strong to save and keep{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Utterly abandoned to The Holy Ghost
Oh the sinking sinking
Till the self is lost
Till the vessel's emptied
Broken at his feet
Waiting till His filling
Makes the work complete{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Utterly abandoned to the will of God
Walking in the pathway
That my Master trod
Leaving ease and pleasure
Making Him my choice
Waiting for His guidance
Listening for His voice{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Utterly abandoned
Through eternity
My will never choosing
His it e'er shall be
All my plans and longings
Lost in His sweet will
Having nothing
Owning all things in Him still{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Utterly abandoned
'Tis so sweet to be
Captive in His love-bonds
Yet so wondrous free
Free from sin's dominion
Free from doubt and fear
Free from every worry
Burden grief or care{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Utterly abandoned
Oh the rest is sweet
Waiting in His presence
At His blessed feet
Waiting for the filling
Of the Host divine
Who my inward parts
Shall perfectly refine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Lo His Spirit fills me
With His presence sweet
I in Him am blessed
I in Him complete
Now the light within me
Never shall grow dim
While abandoned ever
Living unto Him{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
