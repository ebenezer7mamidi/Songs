Didst go alone.
Death had on Thee no claim,
Thou sinless One!
He who had death’s dread pow’r
Met Thee in that dark hour:
Vanquished by Thee his power,
By Thee alone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}But Thou hast burst the grave,
Risen art Thou;
Death could not Thee enslave,
Death had to bow!
Victorious hast Thou come
Out of the darksome tomb,
Broken the bands of gloom:
Beyond death now.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}What mighty triumphs, Lord,
Thou didst achieve!
What fruitfulness doth God
From Thee receive!
Out of Thy death has sprung
A wondrous living throng:
All, all to Thee belong,
And in Thee live.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Firstborn of all Thou art,
Lowly we bow;
Chief in Thy Father’s heart—
Chief to us now.
Thou art indeed supreme,
Our great eternal theme,
Worthy of all esteem:
Worthy art Thou!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
