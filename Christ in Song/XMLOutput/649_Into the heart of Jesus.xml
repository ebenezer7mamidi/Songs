Deeper and deeper I go
Seeking to know the reason
Why He should love me so
Why He should stoop to lift me
Up from the miry clay
Saving my soul making me whole
Though I had wandered away{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Into the will of Jesus
Deeper and deeper I go
Praying for grace to follow
Seeking His way to know
Bowing in full surrender
Low at His blessed feet
Bidding Him take
Break me and make
Till I am molded complete{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Into the cross of Jesus
Deeper and deeper I go
Following through the garden
Facing the dreaded foe
Drinking the cup of sorrow
Sobbing with broken heart
O Savior help dear Savior help
Grace for my weakness impart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Into the joy of Jesus
Deeper and deeper I go
Rising with soul enraptured
Far from the world below
Joy in the place of sorrow
Peace in the midst of pain
Jesus will give Jesus will give
He will uphold and sustain{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Into the love of Jesus
Deeper and deeper I go
Praising the One who brought me
Out of my sin and woe
And through eternal ages
Gratefully I shall sing
O how He loved O how He loved
Jesus my Lord and my King{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
