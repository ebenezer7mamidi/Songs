It is because my Father's will I see
Proving that love behind each sorrow dwells
And sorrow's pathway only mercy spells{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Love's pressure brings out fragrance rare and sweet
Because beneath the weight Himself I meet
And in the sunshine of His blessed face
There flows from me some answer to His grace{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Then chastening proves the love remains the same
As when it first to plough its furrows came
But room is left when self is turned aside
To let the fragrance of that love abode{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
