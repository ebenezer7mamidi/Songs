Help me Lord to go with Thee
All the way to Calvary{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Crucified with Christ my Savior
To the world and self and sin

I am going with my Savior
All the way to Calvary{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}'Tis not hard to die with Jesus
When His risen life we know
'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings
When our hearts with joy o'erflow
In His resurrection power
He has come to dwell in me
And my heart is gladly going
All the way to Calvary{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}If we die we'll live with Jesus
If we suffer we shall reign
Only thus the prize of glory
Can the conqueror attain
Oh how sweet on that glad morning
Should the Master say to thee
"Yes my child thou didst go with me
All the way to Calvary"{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
