We know not how to pray
Save as His Spirit in our hearts
Shall teach us what to say{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Christ is the Omega of prayer
The Father's great Amen
That rounds our halting periods
To sense beyond our ken{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}But in the little space between
He lets us make the links
And with our slow and stammering speech
Interpret what He thinks{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O First and Last take Thou the prayers
Of every trusting soul
And weld them to Thine own desire
To make a perfect whole{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou great Begining of that Word
We cannot speak or spell
Of the short syllable we lisp
Be Thou the End as well{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
