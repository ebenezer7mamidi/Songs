sweetest name I know,
fills my every longing,
keeps me singing as I go.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}There's within my heart a melody
Jesus whispers sweet and low:
Fear not, I am with thee, peace, be still,
in all of life's ebb and flow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}All my life was wrecked by sin and strife,
discord filled my heart with pain;
Jesus swept across the broken strings,
stirred the slumbering chords again.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Feasting on the riches of his grace,
resting neath his sheltering wing,
always looking on his smiling face,
that is why I shout and sing.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Though sometimes he leads through waters deep,
trials fall across the way,
though sometimes the path seems rough and steep,
see his footprints all the way.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Soon he's coming back to welcome me
far beyond the starry sky;
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown;
I shall reign with him on high.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
