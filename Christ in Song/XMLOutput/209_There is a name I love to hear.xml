O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}There is a name I love to hear,
I love to speak its worth;
It sounds like music in mine ear,
The sweetest name on earth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It tells me of a Savior’s love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner’s perfect plea.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}It tells me what my Father hath
In store for every day,
And though I tread a darksome path,
Yields sunshine all the way.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe;
Who in my sorrow bears a part,
That none can bear below.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus, the name I love so well,
The name I love to hear!
No saint on earth its worth can tell,
No heart conceive how dear.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}This name shall shed its fragrance still
Along this thorny road,
Shall sweetly smooth the rugged hill
That leads me up to God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}And there, with all the blood-bought throng,
From sin and sorrow free,
I’ll sing the new eternal song
Of Jesus’ love to me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
