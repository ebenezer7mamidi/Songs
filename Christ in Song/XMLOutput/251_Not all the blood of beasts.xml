On Jewish altars slain,
Could give the guilty conscience peace,
Or wash away its stain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,
Takes all our sins away;
A sacrifice of nobler name,
And richer blood than they.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}My faith would lay her hand
On that dear head of Thine,
While like a penitent I stand,
And there confess my sin.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}My soul looks back to see
The burdens Thou didst bear
When hanging on the cursed tree,
And knows her guilt was there.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Believing, we rejoice
To see the curse remove;
We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,
And sing His bleeding love.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
