On earth as more than conqueror
Victorious o'er
The worldly life around
Mark well the pathway
That thy Lord hath trodden
Since here alone
The secret can be found{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He died and by
His death He dealt the death-blow
To sin and Satan's
Power for evermore
And they who die
With Him shall rise victorious
And "in this sign"
Shall triumph more and more{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The Cross henceforth
Their mark of perfect freedom
What can they lose
Who have surrendered all
What can they fear
Who have no reputation
What shall they shrink from
When His voice doth call{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}"In this sign" therefore
Go hence forth and conquer
Finding the place
Of death the gate of life
"Life more abundant"
Life in all its fulness
In the deep calm of God
Set free from strife{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
