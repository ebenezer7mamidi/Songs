Heralds proclaim
Jesus as Lord of all
Sound forth His fame
Tell of His great renown
Lift high the kingly crown
Let ev'ry knee bow down
At His blest name{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Who will go forth for Him
Who will arise
Though eyes with tears are dim
Severed love's ties
Counting all things but loss
Earth's highest gain but dross
And glorying in the cross
Who will arise{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Go for the crowning day
Draws ever near
Time will soon pass away
Jesus be here
Raise ye the cross where now
Nations to idols bow
Dawn o'er the mountain's brow
Tells He is near{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Hark to the trumpet-blast
Jesus is King
He comes to reign at last
All conquering
Then the wide world shall own
Bending before His throne
Jesus is King alone
Jesus is King{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
