Thee will I love my joy my crown
Thee will I love with all my power
In all thy works and Thee alone
Thee will I love till the pure fire
Fill my whole soul with chaste desire{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Ah why did I so late Thee know
Thee lovelier than the sons of men
Ah why did I no sooner go
To Thee the only ease in pain
Ashamed I sigh and inly mourn
That I so late to Thee did turn{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In darkness willingly I strayed
I sought Thee yet
from Thee I roved
Far wide my wandering
thoughts were spread
Thy creatures more
than Thee I loved
And now if more at length I see
'Tis through Thy light
and comes from Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I thank Thee uncreated Sun
That Thy bright beams
on me have shined
I thank Thee who
hast overthrown
My foes and healed
my wounded mind
I thank Thee whose
enlivening voice
Bids my freed heart
in Thee rejoice{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Uphold me in the doubtful race
Nor suffer me again to stray
Strengthen my feet with steady pace
Still to press forward in Thy way
My soul and flesh O Lord of might
Fill satiate with Thy heavenly light{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Give to mine eyes refreshing tears
Give to my heart chaste hallowed fires
Give to my soul with filial fears
The love that all heaven's host inspires
That all my powers with all their might
In thy sole glory may unite{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Thee will I love my joy my crown
Thee will I love my Lord my God
Thee will I love beneath Thy frown
Or smile Thy scepter or Thy rod
What though my flesh and heart decay
Thee shall I love in endless day{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
