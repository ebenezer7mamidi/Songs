Ah, this is rest indeed:
What else, Almighty Savior,
Can a poor sinner need?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}On Thee my heart is resting,
Ah, this is rest indeed:
What else, Almighty Savior,
Can a poor sinner need?
Thy light is all my wisdom,
Thy love is all my stay;
Thy coming back in glory,
Draws nearer every day.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}My guilt is great, but greater
The mercy Thou dost give;
Thyself, a spotless Off’ring,
Hast died that I should live.
With Thee, my soul unfettered
Has risen from the dust;
Thy blood is all my treasure,
Thy word is all my trust.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Through me, Thou gentle Master,
Thy purposes fulfil;
I yield myself forever
To Thy most holy will.
What though I be but weakness?
My strength is not in me;
The poorest of Thy people
Has all things, having Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}When clouds are darkest round me,
Thou, Lord, art then most near,
My drooping faith to quicken,
My weary soul to cheer.
Safe nestling in Thy bosom,
I gaze upon Thy face;
In vain my foes would drive me
From Thee, my hiding-place.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}’Tis Thou hast made me happy,
’Tis Thou hast set me free;
To whom shall I give glory
Forever, but to Thee?
Of earthly love and blessing
Should every stream run dry,
Thy grace shall still be with me,
Thy grace, to live and die.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
