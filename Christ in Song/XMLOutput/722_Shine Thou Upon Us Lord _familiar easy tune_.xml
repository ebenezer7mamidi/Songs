True light of men today
And through the written Word
Thy very self display
That so from hearts which burn
With gazing on Thy face
Thy little ones may learn
The wonders of Thy grace{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Breathe Thou upon us Lord
Thy Spirit's living flame
That so with one accord
Our lips may tell Thy name
Give Thou the hearing ear
Fix Thou the wand'ring thought
That those we teach may hear
The great things Thou hast wrought{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Speak Thou for us O Lord
In all we say of Thee
According to Thy Word
Let all our teaching be
That so Thy lambs may know
Their own true Shepherd's voice
Where'er He leads them go
And in His love rejoice{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Live Thou within us Lord
Thy mind and will be ours
Be Thou beloved adored
And served with all our powers
That so our lives may teach
Thy children what Thou art
And plead by more than speech
For Thee with ev'ry heart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
