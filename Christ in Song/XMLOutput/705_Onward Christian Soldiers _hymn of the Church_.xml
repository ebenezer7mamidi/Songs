Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}Onward Christian soldiers
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before
Christ the royal Master
Leads against the foe
Forward into battle
See His Banner go{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}At the name of Jesus
Satan's host doth flee
On then Christian soldiers
On to victory
Hell's foundations quiver
At the shout of praise
Brothers lift your voices
Loud your anthems raise{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Like a mighty army
Moves the church of God
Brothers we are treading
Where the saints have trod
We are not divided
All one body we
One in faith and Spirit
One in charity{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Crowns and thrones may perish
Kingdoms rise and wane
But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain
Gates of hell can never
'Gainst the Church prevail
We have Christ's own promise
Which can never fail{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Onward then ye people
Join our happy throng
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song
Glory laud and honor
Unto Christ the King
This thru countless ages
Men and angels sing{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
