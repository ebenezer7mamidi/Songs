As objects of Thy grace,
Who for Thine own heart’s pleasure
Are now before Thy face:
Thy sons marked out for glory
Known from eternity
With Christ Thy Well-beloved,
Object supreme to Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Who else but Thee, O Father,
Could in Thine only Son
So bless us with Thy Spirit,
And have us for Thine own?
Soon shall we be forever
With Christ in glory; then
We’ll shine in His blest image
Eternally, Amen!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
