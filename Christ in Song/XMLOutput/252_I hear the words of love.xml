I gaze upon the blood,
I see the mighty sacrifice,
And I have peace with God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}’Tis everlasting peace!
Sure as Jehovah’s Name,
’Tis stable as His steadfast throne,
For evermore the same.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The clouds may go and come,
And storms may sweep my sky;
This blood-sealed friendship changes not,
The Cross is ever nigh.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}My love is ofttimes low,
My joy still ebbs and flows,
But peace with Him remains the same,
No change my Savior knows.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I change, He changes not;
The Christ can never die;
His love, not mine, the resting-place,
His truth, not mine, the tie.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}The Cross still stands unchanged,
Though heaven is now His home;
The mighty stone is rolled away,
But yonder is His tomb!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}And yonder is my peace,
The grave of all my woes!
I know the Son of God has come,
I know He died and rose.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}I know He liveth now
At God’s right hand above;
I know the throne on which He sits,
I know His truth and love!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
