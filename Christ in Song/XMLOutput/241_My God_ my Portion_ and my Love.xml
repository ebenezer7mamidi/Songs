My everlasting All,
I’ve none but Thee in heav’n above,
Or on this earthly ball,
Or on this earthly ball.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}What empty things are all the skies,
And this inferior clod!
There’s nothing here deserves my joys,
There’s nothing like my God,
There’s nothing like my God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends,
And health, and safe abode;
Thanks to Thy name for meaner things,
But they are not my God,
But they are not my God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}How vain a toy is glittering wealth,
If once compared to Thee!
Or what’s my safety, or my health,
Or all my friends to me,
Or all my friends to me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Were I possessor of the earth,
And called the stars my own,
Without Thy graces and Thyself,
I were a wretch undone,
I were a wretch undone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Let others stretch their arms like seas,
And grasp in all the shore;
Grant me the visits of Thy grace,
And I desire no more,
And I desire no more.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
