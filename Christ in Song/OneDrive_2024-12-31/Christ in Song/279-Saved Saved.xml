    <verse name="v1">
      <lines> I've found a friend who is all to me,
His love is ever true;
I love to tell how He lifted me,
And what His grace can do for you.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Saved by His pow'r, by His pow'r divine,
Saved to new life, to new life sublime!
Life now is sweet and my joy is complete,
For I'm saved, saved, saved.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>He saves me from ev'ry sin and harm,
Secures my soul each day;
I'm leaning strong on His mighty armâ€“
I know He'll guide me all the way.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>When poor and needy and all alone,
In love He said to me,
"Come unto Me and I'll lead you home
To live with Me eternally."</lines>
    </verse>
