    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I heard an old, old story how a Savior came from glory,
How He gave His life on Calvary to save a wretch like me;
I heard about His groaning, of His precious bloodâ€™s atoning,
Then I repented of my sins and won the victory</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O victory in Jesus, my Savior, forever!
He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him.
He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I heard about His healing, of His cleansing power revealing.
How He made the lame to walk again and caused the blind to see;
And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit,"
And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I heard about a mansion He has built for me in glory.
And I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing and the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I'll sing up there the song of victory.</lines>
    </verse>
