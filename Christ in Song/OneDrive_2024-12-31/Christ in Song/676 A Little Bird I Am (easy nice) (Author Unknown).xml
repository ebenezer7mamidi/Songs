    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A little bird I am<br/>Shut from the fields of air<br/>And in my cage I sit and sing<br/>To him who placed me there<br/>Well pleased a prisoner to be<br/>Because my God it pleaseth Thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Nought have I else to do<br/>I sing the whole day long<br/>And He whom most I love to please<br/>Doth listen to my song<br/>He caught and bound my wandering wing<br/>But still He bends to hear me sing</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Thou hast an ear to hear<br/>A heart to love and bless<br/>And though my notes were e'er so rude<br/>Thou wouldst not hear the less<br/>Because Thou knowest as they fall<br/>That love sweet love inspires them all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>My cage confines me round<br/>Abroad I cannot fly<br/>But though my wing is closely bound<br/>My hearts at liberty<br/>For prison walls cannot control<br/>The flight - the freedom of the soul</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>O it is good to soar<br/>These bolts and bars above<br/>To Him whose purpose I adore<br/>Whose providence I love<br/>And in Thy mighty will to find<br/>The joy the freedom of the mind</lines>
    </verse>
