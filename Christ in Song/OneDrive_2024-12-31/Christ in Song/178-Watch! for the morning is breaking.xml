    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Watch! for the morning is breaking,
  A moment, and He will be here!
The mists and the shadows are fleeing,
  The darkness will soon disappear;
And He, for whom ages have waited,
  The Lord Who has tarried so long,
Will come in an outburst of glory,
  A moment, and we shall be gone.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Watch! for the morning is breaking,
  A moment, the crown will be won!
A moment, and we shall be with Him,
  A moment, the journey is done!
Lord, keep us each moment unsleeping,
  And count us all worthy to be
In that noble band of Thy watchers,
  Whose life is a vigil with Thee</lines>
