    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus Christ, my righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesusâ€™ name.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
  All other ground is sinking sand.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>When darkness veils His lovely face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
In Him, my righteousness, alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.</lines>
    </verse>
