    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I sing the mighty pow’r of God, that made the mountains rise,<br/>That spread the flowing seas abroad, and built the lofty skies.<br/>I sing the wisdom that ordained the sun to rule the day;<br/>The moon shines full at His command, and all the stars obey.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I sing the goodness of the Lord, who filled the earth with food,<br/>Who formed the creatures through the Word, and then pronounced them good.<br/>Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed, where’er I turn my eye,<br/>If I survey the ground I tread, or gaze upon the sky.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>There’s not a plant or flow’r below, but makes Thy glories known,<br/>And clouds arise, and tempests blow, by order from Thy throne;<br/>While all that borrows life from Thee is ever in Thy care;<br/>And everywhere that we can be, Thou, God, art present there.</lines>
