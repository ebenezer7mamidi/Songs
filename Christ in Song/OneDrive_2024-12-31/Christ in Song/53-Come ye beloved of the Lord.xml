    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come ye beloved of the Lord and consider all the love
	  that the Father has poured out on you.
	  With joyful hearts in one accord come and look upon the love
	  of the One who gave His all for you.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Our God withheld not His own Son
	  the treasure of His heart poured out for you.
	  If He withheld not His own Son
	  what now would He withhold from you, His own?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>My friend consider then the price that so willingly He paid
	  to redeem and win you back to Him. 
	  Consider how then you will live and just how to spend your days
	  and the freedom He has won for you.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>With all the treasures of the Fatherâ€™s throne of the earth and of the sky
	  and of the universe beyond
	  Our Father chose instead His Son counting His worth far beyond
	  all the treasures of His kingdom home.</lines>
    </verse>
