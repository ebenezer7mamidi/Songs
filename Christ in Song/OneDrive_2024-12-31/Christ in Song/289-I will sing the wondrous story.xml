    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I will sing the wondrous story
  Of the Christ who died for me,
How He left His home in glory
  For the cross of Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Sing, O sing the wondrous story
  Of the Christ who died for me,
Sing it with the saints in glory,
    Gathered by the crystal sea.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I was lost, but Jesus found me,
  Found the sheep that went astray,
Threw His loving arms around me,
  Drew me back into His way.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I was bruised, but Jesus healed me;
  Faint was I from many a fall;
Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,
  But He freed me from them all.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Days of darkness still come o’er me,
  Sorrow’s paths I often tread,
But the Savior still is with me;
  By His hand I’m safely led.</lines>
    </verse>
