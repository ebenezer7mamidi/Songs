    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
  When conscious of thy sin,
Its heavy weight upon thee,
  Its mighty pow’r within:
Then is the hour for pleading
  His finished work for thee:
Then is the time for singing,
  His blood was shed for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
  When tempted to transgress,
By word or look of anger,
  Or thought of bitterness:
Then is the hour for claiming
  Thy Lord to fight for thee:
Then is the time for singing,
  He doth deliver me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
  When daily cares perplex,
And trifles seem so mighty
  Thy inner soul to vex:
Then is the hour for grasping
  His hand who walked the sea:
Then is the time for singing
  He makes it calm for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
  When thou art wearied sore,
When head or hand refuses
  To think or labor more:
Then is the hour for leaning
  Upon the Master’s breast:
Then is the time for singing,
  My Savior gives me rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>O trust thyself to Jesus,
When thou art full of care,
For loved ones still refusing
Our blessed hope to share. 
Then is the hour for trusting
Thy Lord to bring them nigh ; 
Then is the time for singing,
He loves them more than I.</lines>
