    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He lives, the great Redeemer lives,
What joy the blest assurance gives!
And now, before His Father, God,
Pleads the full merits of His blood.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Repeated crimes awake our fears,
And Justice armed with frowns appears;
But in the Saviorâ€™s lovely face
Sweet Mercy smiles, and all is peace.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Hence, then, ye black, despairing thoughts;
Above our fears, above our faults,
His mighty intercessions rise,
And guilt recedes, and terror dies.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>In every dark, distressful hour,
When sin and Satan join their power,
Let this dear hope repel the dart,
That Jesus bears us on His heart.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Great Advocate, almighty Friend!
On Him our humble hopes depend;
Our cause can never, never fail,
For Jesus pleads, and must prevail.</lines>
    </verse>
