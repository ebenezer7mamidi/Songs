    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Redeemed—how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child, and forever, I am.</lines>

      <lines>
 	Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
  His child, and forever, I am.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose way I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night.</lines>
