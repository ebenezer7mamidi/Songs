    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,
My Savior, Jesus; yet this soul of mine
Would of Thy love in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
    Know more and more.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine,
My Savior, Jesus; yet these lips of mine
Would fain proclaim to sinners, far and near,
A love which can remove all guilty fear,
    And love beget.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,
My Savior, Jesus; yet this heart of mine
Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,
Which brings a rebel sinner, such as me,
    Nigh unto God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>But though I cannot sing, or tell, or know
The fulness of Thy love, while here below,
My empty vessel I may freely bring;
O Thou, who art of love the living spring,
    My vessel fill.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>I am an empty vessel—not one thought
Or look of love to Thee I’ve ever brought;
Yet I may come, and come again to Thee,
With this the empty sinner’s only plea,
    Thou lovest me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Oh, fill me, Jesus, Savior, with Thy love!
Lead, lead me to the living fount above;
Thither may I, in simple faith draw nigh,
And never to another fountain fly,
    But unto Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>Lord Jesus, when Thee face to face I see,
When on Thy lofty throne I sit with Thee,
Then of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
    My soul shall sing.</lines>
    </verse>
