    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's within my heart a melody
Jesus whispers sweet and low:
Fear not, I am with thee, peace, be still,
in all of life's ebb and flow.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
sweetest name I know,
fills my every longing,
keeps me singing as I go.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>All my life was wrecked by sin and strife,
discord filled my heart with pain;
Jesus swept across the broken strings,
stirred the slumbering chords again.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Feasting on the riches of his grace,
resting neath his sheltering wing,
always looking on his smiling face,
that is why I shout and sing.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Though sometimes he leads through waters deep,
trials fall across the way,
though sometimes the path seems rough and steep,
see his footprints all the way.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Soon he's coming back to welcome me
far beyond the starry sky;
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown;
I shall reign with him on high.</lines>
    </verse>
