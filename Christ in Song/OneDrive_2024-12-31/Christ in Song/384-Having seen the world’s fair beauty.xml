    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Having seen the world’s fair beauty,
  Lord, I would be blind once more,
Lest I lose the loving Presence
  And Delight I knew before.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Having seen the world’s fair beauty,
Lord, I would be blind once more,
Lest I lose the loving Presence
  And Delight I knew before.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight,
  I can see in paradise,
But while here on earth His mercy
  For my blindness will suffice.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I no more would be delivered
  From my thorn, but look for grace,
While within the veil His glory
  Shineth brightly on my face.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>In the deep dark night, His beauty
  I by faith, not sight, may trace;
He was ridiculed and hated,
  Yet I see His glorious face.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Sun and moonlight far surpassing,
  Clouds and Milky Way o’erspread,
Is the glory all transcending
  Shining from His thorn-crowned head.</lines>
    </verse>
