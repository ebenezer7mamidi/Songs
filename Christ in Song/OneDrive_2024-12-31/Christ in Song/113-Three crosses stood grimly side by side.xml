    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Three crosses stood grimly side by side 
On the hill of Calvary; 
On each a suffering man had died; 
Two for their crimes, the other for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Like a lamb they led Him out to die 
From shades of Gethsemane; 
He uttered no moan, no bitter cry; 
'Twas love that moved Him to die for me. </lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>On the central cross they nailed my Friend, 
To languish in agony; 
He bore it all to the bitter end â€” 
O wonderful love, He died for me. </lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>"If Thou art the Christ," they taunting, said, 
"Come down from the cursed tree;" 
He heeded no jeering word they said. 
But, bowing His head. He died for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Like a wandering sheep I had gone astray, 
But all my iniquity 
My God laid on Him that awful day, 
When, bearing my sins, He died for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Oh, thanks for the love that brought Him down. 
Love, fathomless, like the sea; 
His brow was pierced by a thorny crown. 
That a crown of life might be given me. </lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>My brother, behold Him, crucified, 
On the cross of Calvary; 
Thy ransom see in that crimson tide; 
Oh freely it flowed for you and me.</lines>
    </verse>
