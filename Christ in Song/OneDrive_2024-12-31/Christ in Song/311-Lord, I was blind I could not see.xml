    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, I was blind: I could not see
in thy marred visage any grace;
but now the beauty of thy face
in radiant vision dawns on me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord, I was deaf: I could not hear
the thrilling music of thy voice;
but now I hear thee and rejoice,
and all thine uttered words are dear.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord, I was dumb: I could not speak
the grace and glory of thy name;
but now, as touched with living flame,
my lips thine eager praises wake.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lord, I was dead: I could not stir
my lifeless soul to come to thee;
but now, since thou hast quickened me,
I rise from sin's dark sepulcher.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Lord, thou hast made the blind to see,
the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak,
the dead to live; and lo, I break
the chains of my captivity!</lines>
    </verse>
