    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Have I an object here below<br/>Which would divide my heart with Thee<br/>Which would divert its even flow<br/>In answer to Thy constancy<br/>Oh teach me quickly to return<br/>And cause my heart afresh to burn</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Have I a hope however dear<br/>Which would defer Thy coming Lord<br/>Which would detain my spirit here<br/>Where naught can lasting joy afford<br/>From it my Savior set me free<br/>To look and long and wait for Thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Be Thou the object bright and fair<br/>To fill and satisfy the heart<br/>My hope to meet Thee in the air<br/>And nevermore from Thee to part<br/>That I may undistracted be<br/>To follow serve and wait for Thee</lines>
    </verse>
