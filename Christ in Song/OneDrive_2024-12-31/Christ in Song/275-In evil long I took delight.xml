    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In evil long I took delight,
Unawed by shame or fear,
Till a new object struck my sight,
And stopped my wild career.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I saw One hanging on a tree,
In agony and blood,
Who fixed His languid eyes on me,
As near His cross I stood.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sure, never to my latest breath,
Can I forget that look;
It seemed to charge me with His death,
Though not a word He spoke.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>My conscience felt and owned the guilt,
And plunged me in despair,
I saw my sins His blood had spilt,
And helped to nail Him there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Alas! I knew not what I did,
But now my tears are vain;
Where shall my trembling soul be hid?
For I the Lord have slain.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>A second look He gave, which said,
I freely all forgive;
This blood is for thy ransom paid;
I die, that thou mayâ€™st live.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>Thus, while His death my sin displays,
In all its blackest hue,
Such is the mystery of grace,
It seals my pardon too.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v8">
      <lines>With pleasing grief and mournful joy,
My spirit now is filled;
That I should such a life destroy,
Yet live by Him I killed.</lines>
    </verse>
