    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Blessed by the fountain of blood<br/>To a world of sinners revealed<br/>Blessed be the dear Son of God<br/>Only by His stripes we are healed<br/>Tho' I've wandered far from His fold<br/>Bringing to my heart pain and woe<br/>Wash me in the blood of the Lamb<br/>And I shall be whiter than snow</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>Whit..................er than the snow<br/>Whiter than the snow whiter than the snow<br/>Whit...................er than the snow<br/>Whiter than the snow whiter than the snow<br/>Wash me in the blood of the Lamb<br/>Wash me in the blood of the Lamb of the Lamb<br/>And I shall be whiter than snow<br/> than snow</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Thorny was the crown that He wore<br/>And the cross His body o'ercame<br/>Grievous were the sorrows He bore<br/>But He suffered thus not in vain<br/>May I to that fountain be led<br/>Made to cleanse my sins here below<br/>Wash me in the blood that he shed<br/>And I shall be whiter than snow</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Father I have wandered from Thee<br/>Often has my heart gone astray<br/>Crimson do my sins seem to me<br/>Water cannot wash them away<br/>Jesus to that fountain of Thine<br/>Leaning on Thy promise I go<br/>Cleanse me by Thy washing divine<br/>And I shall be whiter than snow</lines>
