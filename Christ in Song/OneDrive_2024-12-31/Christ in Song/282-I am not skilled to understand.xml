    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I am not skilled to understand
What God hath willed, what God hath planned;
I only know at His right hand
  Stands One who is my Savior.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I take Him at His word indeed:
“Christ died for sinners”—this I read;
For in my heart I find a need
  Of Him to be my Savior!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>And was there then no other way
For God to take? - I cannot say;
I only bless Him, day by day,
Who saved me through my Saviour.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>That He should leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die,
You count it strange? So once did I
  Before I knew my Savior!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>And, oh, that He fulfilled may see
The travail of His soul in me,
And with His work contented be,
  As I with my dear Savior!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Yes, living, dying, let me bring
My strength, my solace from this spring—
That He who lives to be my King
  Once died to be my Savior!</lines>
    </verse>
