    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O eyes that are weary<br/>And hearts that are sore<br/>Look off unto Jesus<br/>And sorrow no more<br/>The light of His countenance<br/>Shineth so bright<br/>That on earth as in heaven<br/>There need be no night</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Looking off unto Jesus<br/>My Spirit is blest<br/>In the world I have turmoil<br/>In Him I have rest<br/>The sea of my life<br/>All about me may roar<br/>When I look unto Jesus<br/>I hear it no more</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Looking off unto Jesus<br/>I go not astray<br/>My eyes are on Him<br/>And He shows me the way<br/>The path may seem dark<br/>As He leads me along<br/>But following Jesus<br/>I cannot go wrong</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Looking off unto Jesus<br/>My heart cannot fear<br/>Its trembling is still<br/>When I see Jesus near<br/>I know that His power<br/>My safeguard will be<br/>For "Why are you troubled"<br/>He saith unto me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Soon, soon shall I know the Full beauty and grace<br/>Of Jesus my Lord when I stand face to face<br/>I shall know how His love Went before me each day<br/>And wonder that ever My eyes turned away</lines>
