    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O God, Thou now hast glorified
Thy holy, blest eternal Son;
The Nazarene, the Crucified,
Now sits exalted on Thy throne:
To Him in faith we cry aloud,
Worthy art Thou, O Lamb of God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Father, Thy holy name we bless,
And gladly hail Thy just decree
That every tongue shall soon confess
Jesus the Lord of all to be;
But oh, Thy grace has taught us now
Before that Lord the knee to bow.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Him as our Lord we gladly own:
To Him alone we now would live,
Who bowed our hearts
before Thy throne,
And gave us all that love could give.
Our willing voices cry aloud,
Worthy art Thou, O Lamb of God.</lines>
    </verse>
