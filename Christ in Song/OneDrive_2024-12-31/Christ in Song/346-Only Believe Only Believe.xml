    <verse name="v1">

From Death Into Life He Went For His Own;
All Power In Earth, All Power Above,
Is Given To Him For The Flock Of His Love.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Only Believe, Only Believe,
All Things Are Possible, Only Believe;
Only Believe, Only Believe,
All Things Are Possible, Only Believe.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Fear Not, Little Flock, He Goeth Ahead,
Your Shepherd Selecteth The Path You Must Tread;
The Waters Of Marah He’ll Sweeten For Thee,
He Drank All The Bitter In Gethsemane.</lines>

	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Fear Not, Little Flock, What Ever Your Lot,
He Enters All Rooms,” The Doors Being Shut;”
He Never Forsakes, He Never Is Gone,
So Count On His Presence In Darkness And Dawn.</lines>
