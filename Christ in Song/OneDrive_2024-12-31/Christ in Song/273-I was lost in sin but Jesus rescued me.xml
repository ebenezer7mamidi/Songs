I was bound by fear but Jesus set me free,
  He’s a wonderful Savior to me.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>For He’s a wonderful Savior to me,
  He’s a wonderful Savior to me;
I was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in,
    He’s a wonderful Savior to me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>He’s a Friend so true, so patient and so kind,
  He’s a wonderful Savior to me;
Everything I need in Him I always find,
  He’s a wonderful Savior to me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>He is always near to comfort and to cheer,

  He’s a wonderful Savior to me;
Sweeter is His grace while pressing on my way,
  He’s a wonderful Savior to me.</lines>
