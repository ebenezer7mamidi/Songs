    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King:
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!"
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With th'angelic hosts proclaim,
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King"</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines> Christ, by highest heaven adored,
Christ, the everlasting Lord,
Late in time behold him come,
Offspring of the Virgin's womb:
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
hail th'incarnate Deity,
Pleased with us in flesh to dwell,
Jesus, our Immanuel.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
Light and life to all he brings,
Risen with healing in his wings.
Mild he lays his glory by,
Born that we no more may die,
Born to raise us from the earth,
Born to give us second birth.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come, Desire of nations, come!
Fix in us Thy humble home:
Rise, the woman’s conqu’ring seed,
Bruise in us the serpent’s head;
Adam’s likeness now efface,
Stamp Thine image in its place:
Final Adam from above,
Reinstate us in Thy love.</lines>
    </verse>
