    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Maker of the universe
As Man, for man was made a curse.
The claims of law which He had made,
Unto the uttermost He paid.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>His holy fingers made the bough
Which grew the thorns that crowned His brow.
The nails that pierced His hands were mined
In secret places He designed.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>He made the forest whence there sprung
The tree on which His body hung.
He died upon a cross of wood,
Yet made the hill on which it stood.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>The sky that darkened oâ€™er His head
By Him above the earth was spread.
The sun that hid from Him its face
By His decree was poised in space.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>The spear which spilled His precious blood
Was tempered in the fires of God.
The grave in which His form was laid,
Was hewn in rocks His hands had made.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>The throne on which He now appears
Was His from everlasting years.
But a new glory crowns His brow.
And every knee to Him shall bow.</lines>
    </verse>
