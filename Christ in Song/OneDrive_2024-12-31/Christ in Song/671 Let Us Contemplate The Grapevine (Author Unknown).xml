    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Let us contemplate the grapevine<br/>From its life now let us learn<br/>How its growth is fraught with suff'ring<br/>Midst enviroment so stern<br/>How unlike the untamed flowers<br/>Growing in the wilderness<br/>In a maze of wild confusion<br/>Making patterns numberless</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>But the blossoms of the grapevine<br/>Without glory are and small<br/>Though they do have some expression<br/>They are hardly seen withal<br/>But a day since they have flowered<br/>Into fruit the blooms have grown<br/>Never may they wave corollas<br/>With luxuriant beauty shown</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>To a post the vine is fastened<br/>Thus it cannot freely grow<br/>When its branches are extended<br/>To the trellis tied they go<br/>To the stony soil committed<br/>Drawing thence its food supply<br/>It can never choose its own way<br/>Or from difficulty fly</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh how beautiful its verdure<br/>Which in spring spreads o'er the field<br/>From life's energy and fullness<br/>Growth abundant doth it yield<br/>Till it's full of tender branches<br/>Twining freely everywhere<br/>Stretching 'gainst the sky's deep azure<br/>Tasting sweetly of the air</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>But the master of the vineyard<br/>Not in lenience doth abide<br/>But with knife and pruning scissors<br/>Then would strip it of its pride<br/>Caring not the vine is tender<br/>But with deep precision stroke<br/>All the pretty excess branches<br/>From the vine are neatly broke</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>In this time of loss and ruin<br/>Does the vine self-pity show<br/>Nay it gives itself more fully<br/>To the hand that strips its branches<br/>Till of beauty destitute<br/>That its life may not be wasted<br/>But preserved for bearing fruit</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Into hard wood slowly hardens<br/>Every stump of bleeding shoot<br/>Each remaining branch becoming<br/>Clusters of abundant fruit<br/>Then beneath the scorching sunshine<br/>Leaves are dried and from it drop<br/>Thus the fruit more richly ripens<br/>Till the harvest of the crop</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>Bowed beneath its fruitful burden<br/>Loaded branches are brought low<br/>Labor of its growth through suff'ring<br/>Many a purposed cutting blow<br/>Now its fruit is fully ripened<br/>Comforted the vine would be<br/>But the harvest soon is coming<br/>And its days of comfort flee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>Hands will pick and feet will trample<br/>All the riches of the vine<br/>Till from out the reddeded wine-press<br/>Flows a river full of wine<br/>All the day its flow continues<br/>Bloody-red without alloy<br/>Gushing freely richly sweetly<br/>Filling all the earth with joy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>In appearance now the grapevine<br/>Barren is and pitiful<br/>Having given all it enters<br/>Into night inscrutable<br/>No one offers to repay it<br/>For the cheering wine that's drunk<br/>But 'tis stripped and cut e'en further<br/>To a bare and branchless trunk</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>Yet its wine throughout the winter<br/>Warmth and sweetness ever bears<br/>Unto those in coldness shiv'ring<br/>Pressed with sorrow pain and cares<br/>Yet without alone the grapevine<br/>Midst the ice and snow doth stand<br/>Steadfastly it lot enduring<br/>Though 'tis hard to understand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v12">
      <lines>Winter o'er the vine prepareth<br/>Fruit again itself to bear<br/>Budding forth and growing branches<br/>Beauteous green again to wear<br/>Never murmuring or complaining<br/>For the winter's sore abuse<br/>Or for all its loss desiring<br/>Its fresh off'ring to reduce</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v13">
      <lines>Breathing air untainted heavenly<br/>As it lifts its arms on high<br/>Earth's impure defiled affections<br/>Ne'er the vine may occupy<br/>Facing sacrifice yet smiling<br/>And while love doth prune once more<br/>Strokes it bears as if it never<br/>Suffered loss and pain before</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v14">
      <lines>From the branches of the grapevine<br/>Sap and blood and wine doth flow<br/>Does the vine for all it suffered<br/>Lost and yielded poorer grow<br/>Drunkards of the earth and wanderers<br/>From it drink and merry make<br/>From their pleasure and enjoyment<br/>Do they richer thereby wake</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v15">
      <lines>Not by gain our life is measured<br/>But by what we've lost 'tis scored<br/>'Tis not how much wine is drunken<br/>But how much has been outpoured<br/>For the strength of love e'er standeth<br/>In the sacrifice we bear<br/>He who has the greatest suff'ring<br/>Ever has the most to share</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v16">
      <lines>He who treats himself severely<br/>Is the best for God to gain<br/>He who hurts himself most dearly<br/>Most can comfort those in pain<br/>He who suffering never beareth<br/>Is but empty "sounding brass"<br/>He who self-life never spareth<br/>Has the joys which all surpass</lines>
    </verse>
