    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Why should I worry doubt and fear<br/>Has God not caused<br/>His Son to bear<br/>my sins upon the tree<br/>The debt that Christ for me has paid<br/>Would God demand it be repaid<br/>And claim again from me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Redemption full the Lord has made<br/>And all my debts has fully paid<br/>From law to set me free<br/>I fear not for the wrath of God<br/>For I've been sprinkled with His blood<br/>It wholly covers me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For me forgiveness He has gained<br/>And full acquittal was obtained<br/>All debts of sin are paid<br/>God would not have His claim on two<br/>First on His Son my Surety true<br/>And then upon me laid</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So now I have full peace and rest<br/>My Savior Christ hath done the best<br/>And set me wholly free<br/>By His all-efficacious blood<br/>I ne'er could be condemned by God<br/>For He has died for me</lines>
