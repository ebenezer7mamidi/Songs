    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Since Thy departure from Olivet’s Mountain,
 	 	Why is Thy coming again so delayed?
 	Thru the long years we have longed for Thy coming;
 	 	Hast Thou not heard all the prayers that we’ve prayed?</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Come Thou, come now;
 	 	Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
 	 	All our desire is Thy promised returning,
 	 	Oh, may Thou quickly return.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Beloved Lord, since the year Thou ascended
 	 	Everything here has been tasteless and dry;
 	Often in praying and often in watching,
 	 	In every movement, for Thee, Lord, we sigh.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Scenes although lovely, yet when will we meet Thee?
 	 	Birds and the flowers fair beauty embrace;
 	All are delightsome, but none satisfy me,
 	 	For I am longing for Thy loving face.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lord, we’re impatient awaiting Thy coming,
 	 	We do not know how much longer ‘twill be;
 	From every sunrise to every bright sunset
 	 	Hope we each moment Thy coming to see.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Whene’er ‘tis raining, or strong winds are blowing,
 	 	Whene’er the moon shines, or rises the sea,
 	We ever hope to discover Thy coming;
 	 	How disappointed when no sign of Thee!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>If it were not for the bidding Thou gav’st us,
 	 	We’d be discouraged, Thy service we’d shirk;
 	But Thou dost want us while waiting Thy coming,
 	 	For Thee to live and in diligence work.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>Oh Lord, remember the days have been lengthened
 	 	Since Thou hast promised ere going away;
 	We hope and hope and are endlessly hoping,
 	 	That Thou wilt come. Canst Thou come e’en today?</lines>
