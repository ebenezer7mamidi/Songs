    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Blessed be God, our God,
Who gave for us His well-beloved Son,
    The gift of gifts, all other gifts in one;
Blessed be God, our God!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>What will He not bestow!
Who freely gave this mighty gift unbought,
    Unmerited, unheeded, and unsought,
What will He not bestow?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>He spared not His Son!
’Tis this that silences each rising fear,
    ’Tis this that bids the hard thought disappear;
He spared not His Son!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Who shall condemn us now?
Since Christ has died, and ris’n, and gone above,
    For us to plead at the right hand of Love;
Who shall condemn us now?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>’Tis God that justifies!
Who shall recall His pardon or His grace?
    Or who the broken chain of guilt replace?
’Tis God that justifies!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>The victory is ours!
For us in might came forth the mighty One;
    For us He fought the fight, the triumph won:
The victory is ours!</lines>
    </verse>
