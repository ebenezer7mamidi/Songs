  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've seen the lightning flashing<br/>And heard the thunder roll<br/>I've felt sin's breakers clashing<br/>Trying to conquer my soul<br/>I've heard the Voice of Jesus<br/>Telling me still to fight on<br/>He promised never to leave me<br/>Never to leave me alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>No never alone - No never alone<br/>He promised never to leave me<br/>Never to leave me alone<br/>No never alone - No never alone<br/>He promised never to leave me<br/>Never to leave me alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The world's fierce winds are blowing<br/>Temptations are sharp and keen<br/>I feel a peace in knowing<br/>My Savior stands between<br/>He stands to shield me from danger<br/>When earthly friends are gone<br/>He promised never to leave me<br/>Never to leave me alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When in affliction's valley<br/>I'm treading the road of care<br/>My Savior helps me to carry<br/>My cross when heavy to bear<br/>My feet entangled with briars<br/>Ready to cast me down<br/>My Savior whispered His promise<br/>Never to leave me alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He died for me on the mountain<br/>For me they pierced His Side<br/>For me He opened the fountain<br/>The crimson cleansing tide<br/>For me He's waiting in glory<br/>Seated upon the throne<br/>He promised never to leave me<br/>Never to leave me alone</lines>
    </verse>
