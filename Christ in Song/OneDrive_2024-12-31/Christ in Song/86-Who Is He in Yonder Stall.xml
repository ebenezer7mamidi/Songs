    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who is He in yonder stall,
At whose feet the shepherds fall?
Who is he in deep distress,
fasting in the wilderness?</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>'Tis the Lord, O wondrous story!
'Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
At his feet we humbly fall,
crown him, crown him, Lord of all!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who is he the people bless
for his words of gentleness?
Who is he to whom they bring
all the sick and sorrowing?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who is he that stands and weeps
at the grave where Lazarus sleeps?
Who is he the gath'ring throng
greet with loud triumphant song?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lo! at midnight, who is he
prays in dark Gethsemane?
Who is he upon the tree
dies in grief and agony?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Who is he that from the grave
comes to heal and help and save?
Who is he that from his throne
rules thro' all the world alone?</lines>
    </verse>
