    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
  That saved a wretch; like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
  Was blind, but now I see.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
  And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
  The hour I first believed!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Lord hath promised good to me,
  His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
  As long as life endures.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
This grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
  Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
  Than when we first begun.</lines>
    </verse>
