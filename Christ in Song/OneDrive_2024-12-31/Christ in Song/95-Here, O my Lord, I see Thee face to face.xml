    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;
Here faith can touch and handle things unseen;
Here would I grasp with firmer hand Thy grace,
And all my weariness upon Thee lean.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Here would I feed upon the Bread of God;
Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav’n;
Here would I lay aside each earthly load;
Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv’n.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Mine is the sin but yours the righteousness;
mine is the guilt but yours the cleansing blood.
Here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace:
your blood, your righteousness, O Lord, my God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>I have no help but Thine; nor do I need
Another arm save Thine to lean upon;
It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;
My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>This is the hour of banquet and of song;
This is the heav’nly table spread for me;
Here let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong
The brief bright hour of fellowship with Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;
The feast, though not the love, is past and gone;
The bread and wine remove, but Thou art here,
Nearer than ever still our Shield and Sun.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,
Yet passing, points to the glad feast above,
Giving sweet foretastes of the festal joy,
The Lamb’s great bridal-feast of bliss and love.</lines>
    </verse>
