    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There were ninety and nine that safely lay<br/>In the shelter of the fold<br/>But one was out on the hills away<br/>Far off from the gates of gold<br/>Away on the mountains wild and bare<br/>Away from the tender Shepherd's care<br/>Away from the tender Shepherd's care</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine<br/>Are they not enough for Thee<br/>But the Shepherd made answer<br/>This of Mine has wandered away from Me<br/>And although the road be rough and steep<br/>I go to the desert to find My sheep<br/>I go to the desert to find My sheep</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>But none of the ransomed ever knew<br/>How deep were the waters crossed<br/>Nor how dark was the night<br/>That the Lord passed through<br/>Ere He found His sheep that was lost<br/>Out in the desert He heard its cry<br/>Sick and helpless and ready to die<br/>Sick and helpless and ready to die</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lord whence are those blood-drops all the way<br/>That mark out the mountain's track<br/>They were shed for one who had gone astray<br/>Ere the Shepherd could bring him back<br/>Lord whence are Thy hands so rent and torn<br/>They're pierced tonight by many a thorn<br/>They're pierced tonight by many a thorn</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>But all thro' the mountains thunder riven<br/>And up from the rocky steep<br/>There arose a glad cry to the gate of heaven<br/>Rejoice I have found My sheep<br/>And the angels echoed around the throne<br/>Rejoice for the Lord brings back His own<br/>Rejoice for the Lord brings back His own</lines>
    </verse>
