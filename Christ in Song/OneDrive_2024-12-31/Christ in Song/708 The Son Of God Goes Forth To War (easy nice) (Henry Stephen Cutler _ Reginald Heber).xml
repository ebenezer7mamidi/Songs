    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Son of God goes forth to war<br/>A kingly crown to gain<br/>His blood-red banner streams afar<br/>Who follows in His train<br/>Who best can drink His cup of woe<br/>Triumphant over pain<br/>Who patient bears His cross below<br/>He follows in His train</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The martyr first whose eagle eye<br/>Could pierce beyond the grave<br/>Who saw His Master in the sky<br/>And called on Him to save<br/>Like Him with pardon on His tongue<br/>In midst of mortal pain<br/>He prayed for them that did the wrong<br/>Who follows in His train</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>A glorious band the chosen few<br/>On whom the Spirit came<br/>Twelve valiant saints their hope they knew<br/>And mocked the cross and flame<br/>They met the tyrant's brandished steel<br/>The lion's gory mane<br/>They bowed their necks the death to feel<br/>Who follows in their train</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>A noble army men and boys<br/>The matron and the maid<br/>Around the Saviour's throne rejoice<br/>In robes of light arrayed<br/>They climbed the steep ascent of heaven<br/>Through peril toil and pain<br/>O God to us may grace be given<br/>To follow in their train</lines>
    </verse>
