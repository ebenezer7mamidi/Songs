    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>For the bread and for the wine,
For the pledge that seals Him mine,
For the words of love divine,
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Only bread and only wine,
Yet to faith, the solemn sign
Of the heav’nly and divine!
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>For the words that turn our eye
To the cross of Calvary,
Bidding us in faith draw nigh,
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>For the words that tell of home,
Pointing us beyond the tomb,
“Do ye this until I come,”
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Till He come we take the bread,
Type of Him on whom we feed,
Him who liveth and was dead!
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Till He come we take the cup;
As we at His table sup,
Eye and heart are lifted up!
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>For that coming, here foreshown,
For that day to man unknown,
For the glory and the throne,
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
