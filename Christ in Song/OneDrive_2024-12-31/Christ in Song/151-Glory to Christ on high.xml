    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Glory to Christ on high!
Let heav'n and earth reply!
Praise ye His name!
His love and grade adore,
Who all our sorrows bore;
Sing loud for evermore, 
“Worthy the Lamb!”</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>While they around the throne
Cheerfully join in one,
Praising his name:
We, who have felt his blood,
Sealing our peace with God,
Sound his dear name abroad,
Worthy the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Join, all ye ransomed race,
Our Lord and God to bless;
Praise ye his name:
In him we will rejoice,
And make a joyful noise,
Shouting with heart and voice,
Worthy the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>What though we change our place,
Yet we shall never cease
Praising his name:
To him our songs we bring—
Hail him our gracious King,
And, without ceasing, sing
Worthy the Lamb.</lines>
