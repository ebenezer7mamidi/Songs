    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O Blessed Saviour, Son of God,
Who hast redeemed us
with Thy blood
From guilt, and death, and shame,
With joy and praise Thy people see
The crown of glory worn by Thee,
And worthy Thee proclaim.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Exalted by the Father's love,
All thrones, and powers,
and names above,
At God's right hand in heaven:
Wisdom and riches, power divine,
Blessing and honour,
Lord, are Thine ---
All things to Thee are given.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Head of the church,
Thou sittest there;
Thy members all the blessings share;
Thy blessing, Lord, is ours:
Our life Thou art; Thy grace sustains;
Thy strength in us each victory gains
O'er sin and Satan's powers</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>And soon, the day of glory come,
Thy bride shall reach
her destined home
And all Thy beauty see:
How great our joy to see Thee shine,
To hear Thee own us, Lord, as Thine,
And ever dwell with Thee!</lines>
    </verse>
