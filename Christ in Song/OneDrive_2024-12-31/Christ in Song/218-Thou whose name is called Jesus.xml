    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Thou whose name is called Jesus,
  Risen Lord of life and pow’r,
Oh, it is so sweet to trust Thee,
  Every day and every hour;
Of Thy wondrous grace I sing,
  Savior, Counsellor, and King.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Thou canst keep my feet from falling,
  Even my poor wayward feet;
Thou who dost present me faultless
  In Thee—Righteousness complete;
Jesus, Lord, in knowing Thee,
  Oh, what strength and victory.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>All the sin in me, my Savior,
  Thou canst conquer and subdue;
With Thy sanctifying power
  Permeate my spirit through;
Let Thy government increase,
  Risen, crowned, Prince of Peace.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thou canst keep me upward looking,
  Ever upward in Thy face;
Thou canst make me stand, upholden
  By the greatness of Thy grace;
Every promise of Thy word
  Now I claim from Thee, dear Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Oh! what joy to trust Thee, Jesus,
  Mighty Victor o’er the grave,
And to learn amid earth’s shadows
  Thine unceasing power to save!
Only those who prove Thee know
  What the grace Thou dost bestow.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Make my life a bright outshining
  Of Thy life, that all may see
Thine own resurrection power
  Mightily put forth in me;
Ever let my heart become
  Yet more consciously Thy home.</lines>
