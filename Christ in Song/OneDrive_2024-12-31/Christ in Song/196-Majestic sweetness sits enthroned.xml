    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Majestic sweetness sits enthroned
  Upon the Savior’s brow;
His head with radiant glories crowned,
  His lips with grace o’erflow.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>No mortal can with Him compare
  Among the sons of men;
Fairer is He than all the fair
  That fill the heavenly train.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>He saw me plunged in deep distress,
and flew to my relief;
for me He bore the shameful cross,
and carried all my grief.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>To Him I owe my life and breath,
  And all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death,
  And saves me from the grave.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>To God, the Father, my abode,
  He brings my weary feet;
Shows me the glories of my God,
  And makes my joys complete.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Since from His bounty I receive
  Such proofs of love divine,
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
  Lord, they should all be Thine.</lines>
    </verse>
