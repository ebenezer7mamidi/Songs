    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Crown Him with many crowns,
  The Lamb upon His throne;
Hark! how the heavâ€™nly anthem drowns
  All music but its own!
  Awake, my soul, and sing
  Of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy matchless King
  Through all eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of Love:
  Behold His hands and side;
Rich wounds yet visible above
  In beauty glorified:
  No angel in the sky
  Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends his burning eye
  At mysteries so bright.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Crown him the Lord of life,
Who triumphed o'er the grave,
And rose victorious in the strife
For those he came to save;
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high,
Who died eternal life to bring,
And lives that death may die.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of years,
  The Potentate of time.
Creator of the rolling spheres,
  Ineffably sublime.
  All hail, Redeemer, hail!
  For Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise shall never, never fail
  Throughout eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Crown Him the Lord of heaven:
One with the Father known,
One with the Spirit through Him given
From yonder glorious throne.
To Thee be endless praise,
For Thou for us hast died;
Be Thou, O Lord, through endless days
Adored and magnified.</lines>
