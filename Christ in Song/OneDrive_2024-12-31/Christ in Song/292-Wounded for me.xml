    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Wounded for me, wounded for me,
There on the cross He was wounded for me;
Gone my transgressions, and now I am free,
All because Jesus was wounded for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Dying for me, dying for me,
There on the cross He was dying for me;
Now in His death my redemption I see,
All because Jesus was dying for me</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Risen for me, risen for me,
Up from the grave He has risen for me;
Now evermore from death’s sting I am free,
All because Jesus has risen for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Living for me, living for me,
Up in the skies He is living for me;
Daily He’s pleading and praying for me,
All because Jesus is living for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Coming for me, coming for me,
Soon in the air He is coming for me;
Then with what joy His dear face I shall see,
Oh, how I praise Him! He’s coming for me.</lines>
    </verse>
