    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, It Belongs Not To My Care
Whether I Die Or Live;
To Love And Serve Thee Is My Share,
And This Thy Grace Must Give.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>If Life Be Long, I Will Be Glad
That I May Long Obey;
If Short, Yet Why Should I Be Sad
To Soar To Endless Day?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Christ Leads Me Through No Darker Rooms
Than He Went Through Before;
He That Into God’s Kingdom Comes
Must Enter By This Door.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come, Lord, When Grace Has Made Me Meet
Thy Blessed Face To See;
For If Thy Work On Earth Be Sweet,
What Will Thy Glory Be?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Then Shall I End My Sad Complaints,
And Weary, Sinful Days,
And Join With The Triumphant Saints
That Sing my Savior's Praise.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>My Knowledge Of That Life Is Small,
The Eye Of Faith Is Dim;
But ‘Tis Enough That Christ Knows All,
And I Shall Be With Him.</lines>
    </verse>
