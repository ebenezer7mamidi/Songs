    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Wonderful birth, to a manger He came,
made in the likeness of man, to proclaim
God’s boundless love for a world sick with sin,
pleading with sinners to let Him come in.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Wonderful name He bears,
wonderful crown He wears,
wonderful blessings His triumphs afford;
wonderful Calvary,
wonderful grace for me,
wonderful love of my wonderful Lord!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Wonderful life, full of service so free,
friend to the poor and the needy was He;
unfailing goodness on all He bestowed,
undying faith in the vilest He showed.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Wonderful death, for it meant not defeat,
Calvary made His great mission complete,
wrought our redemption, and when He arose,
banished for ever the last of our foes.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Wonderful hope, He is coming again,
coming as King o’er the nations to reign;
glorious promise, His word cannot fail,
His righteous kingdom at last must prevail!</lines>
    </verse>
