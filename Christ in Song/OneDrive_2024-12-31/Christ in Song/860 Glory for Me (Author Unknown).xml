    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh, that will be glory for me,<br/>Glory for me,<br/>Glory for me;<br/>When by His grace I shall look on His face,<br/>That will be glory, be glory for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When by the gift of His infinite grace,<br/>I am accorded in heaven a place,<br/>Just to be there and to look on His face,<br/>Will through the ages be glory for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Friends will be there I have loved long ago;<br/>Joy like a river around me will flow;<br/>Yet, just a smile from my Savior, I know,<br/>Will through the ages be glory for me.</lines>
