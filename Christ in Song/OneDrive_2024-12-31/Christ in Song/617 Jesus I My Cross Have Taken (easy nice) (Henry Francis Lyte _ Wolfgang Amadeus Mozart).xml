    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus I my cross have taken<br/>All to leave and follow Thee<br/>Destitute despised forsaken<br/>Thou from hence my all shalt be<br/>Perish every fond ambition<br/>All I've sought and hoped and known<br/>Yet how rich is my condition<br/>God and heaven are still my own</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Let the world despise and leave me<br/>They have left my Savior too<br/>Human hearts and looks deceive me<br/>Thou art not like man untrue<br/>And while Thou shalt smile upon me<br/>God of wisdom love and might<br/>Foes may hate and friends may shun me<br/>Show Thy face and all is bright</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Man may trouble and distress me<br/>'Twill but drive me to Thy breast<br/>Life with trials hard may press me<br/>Heav'n will bring me sweeter rest<br/>O 'tis not in grief to harm me<br/>While Thy love is left to me<br/>O 'twere not in joy to charm me<br/>Were that joy unmixed with Thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Go then earthly fame and treasure<br/>Come disaster scorn and pain<br/>In Thy service pain is pleasure<br/>With Thy favor loss is gain<br/>I have called Thee Abba Father<br/>I have stayed my heart on Thee<br/>Storms may howl and clouds may gather<br/>All must work for good to me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Haste thee on from grace to glory<br/>Armed by faith and winged by prayer<br/>Heaven's eternal days before thee<br/>God's own hand shall guide thee there<br/>Soon shall close thy earthly mission<br/>Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days<br/>Hope shall change to glad fruition<br/>Faith to sight and prayer to praise</lines>
    </verse>
