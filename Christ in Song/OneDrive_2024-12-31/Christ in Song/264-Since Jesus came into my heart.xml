    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
    Since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Since Jesus came into my heart!
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o’er my soul like the sea billows roll,
  Since Jesus came into my heart!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I have ceased from my wand’ring and going astray,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!
And my sins which were many are all washed away,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I’m possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!
And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>There’s a light in the valley of death now for me,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!
And the gates of the City beyond I can see,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I shall go there to dwell in that City I know,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!
And I’m happy, so happy as onward I go,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!</lines>
    </verse>
