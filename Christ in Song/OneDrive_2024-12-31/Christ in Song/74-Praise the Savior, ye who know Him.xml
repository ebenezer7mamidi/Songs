    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise the Savior, ye who know Him!
Who can tell how much we owe Him?
Gladly let us render to Him
  All we are and have.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus is the name that charms us;
He for conflicts fits and arms us;
Nothing moves and nothing harms us
  When we trust in Him.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Trust in Him, ye saints, forever;
He is faithful, changing never;
Neither force nor guile can sever
  Those He loves from Him.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Keep us, Lord, oh, keep us cleaving
To Thyself and still believing,
Till the hour of Thy receiving
  The victorious Bride.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Then we shall be where we would be;
Then we shall be what we should be;
Things which are not now, nor could be,
  Then shall be our own.</lines>
