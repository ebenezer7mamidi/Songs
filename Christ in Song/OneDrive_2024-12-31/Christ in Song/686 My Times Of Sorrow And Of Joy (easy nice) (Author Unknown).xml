    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My times of sorrow and of joy<br/>Great God are in Thy hand<br/>My choicest comforts come from Thee<br/>And go at Thy command</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>If Thou shouldst take them all away<br/>Yet would I not repine<br/>Before they were possesed by me<br/>They were entirely Thine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Nor would I drop a murmuring word<br/>Though the whole world were gone<br/>But seek enduring happiness<br/>In Thee and Thee alone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>What is the world with all its store<br/>'Tis but a bitter sweet<br/>When I attempt to pluck the rose<br/>A pricking thorn I meet</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Here perfect bliss can ne'er be found<br/>The honey's mixed with gall<br/>Midst changing scenes and dying friends<br/>Be Thou my all in all</lines>
    </verse>
