    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Begone, unbelief,
  My Savior is near,
And for my relief
  Will surely appear;
By prayer let me wrestle,
  And He will perform;
With Christ in the vessel,
  I smile at the storm.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Though dark be my way,
  Since He is my Guide,
’Tis mine to obey,
  ’Tis His to provide;
Though cisterns be broken,
  And creatures all fail,
The word He hath spoken
  Shall surely prevail.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>His love, in time past,
  Forbids me to think
He’ll leave me at last
  In trouble to sink:
Each sweet Ebenezer
  I have in review
Confirms His good pleasure
  To help me quite through.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Why should I complain
  Of want or distress,
Temptation or pain?
  He told me no less;
The heirs of salvation,
  I know from His Word,
Through much tribulation
  Must follow their Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>How bitter that cup
  No heart can conceive,
Which He drank quite up,
  That sinners might live!
His way was much rougher
  And darker than mine;
Did Christ, my Lord, suffer,
  And shall I repine?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Since all that I meet
  Shall work for my good,
The bitter is sweet,
  The medicine, food;
Though painful at present,
  ’Twill cease before long,
And then, oh, how pleasant
  The conqueror’s song!</lines>
    </verse>
