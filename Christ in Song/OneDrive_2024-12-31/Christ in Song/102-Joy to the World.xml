    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Joy to the world, the Savior reigns
Let all their songs employ
While fields and floods rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>No more let sins and sorrows grow
nor thorns infest the ground;
he comes to make his blessings flow
far as the curse is found,
far as the curse is found,
far as, far as the curse is found.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>He rules the world with truth and grace
and makes the nations prove
the glories of his righteousness
and wonders of his love,
and wonders of his love,
and wonders, wonders of his love.</lines>
    </verse>
