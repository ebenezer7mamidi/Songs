    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Hail, Thou once despised Jesus!
  Hail, Thou still rejected King!
Thou didst suffer to release us,
  Thou didst free salvation bring;
Through Thy death and resurrection,
  Bearer of our sin and shame!
We enjoy divine protection,
  Life and glory through Thy name.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Paschal Lamb, by God appointed,
  All our sins on Thee were laid;
By our Father’s love anointed,
  Thou redemption’s price hast paid.
All who trust Thee are forgiven
  Through the virtue of Thy blood;
Opened are the things of heaven,
  Grace shines forth to man from God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus, hail! enthroned in glory,
  Where for us Thou dost abide;
We, by faith, do now adore Thee,
  Seated at Thy Father’s side.
There, for us Thou now art pleading,
  There Thou dost our sorrows share,
Ever for us interceding,
  Till in glory we appear.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Worship, honor, praise, and blessing,
  Thou art worthy to receive;
Loudest praises, without ceasing,
  Meet it is for us to give.
In that day Thy saints will meet Thee,
  Welcome Thee with grateful song;
Joyful hearts will ever greet Thee,
  Source of joy to all the throng!</lines>
    </verse>
