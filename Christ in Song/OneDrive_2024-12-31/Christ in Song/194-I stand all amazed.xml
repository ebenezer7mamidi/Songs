    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,
Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;
I tremble to know that for me He was crucified,
That for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled and died.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O it is wonderful that He should care for me
  Enough to die for me!
  O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I marvel that He would descend from His throne divine
To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;
That He should extend His great love unto such as I,
Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I think of His side, pierced and bleeding to pay the debt,
Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?
No, no! I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,
And testify all my desires He doth fully meet.</lines>
    </verse>
