  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I was sinking deep in sin,
  Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
  Sinking to rise no more;
But the Master of the sea
  Heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me,
  Now safe am I.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Love lifted me!
Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help,
  Love lifted me.
Love lifted me!
Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help,
  Love lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>All my heart to Him I give,
  Ever to Him I’ll cling,
In His blessed presence live,
  Ever His praises sing.
Love so mighty and so true
  Merits my soul’s best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too,
  To Him belongs.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Souls in danger, look above,
  Jesus completely saves;
He will lift you by His love
  Out of the angry waves.
He’s the Master of the sea,
  Billows His will obey;
He your Savior wants to be—
  Be saved today.</lines>
    </verse>
