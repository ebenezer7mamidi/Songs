    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>From pole to pole let others roam<br/>And serach in vain for bliss<br/>My soul is satisfied at home<br/>The Lord my portion is</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus who on His glorious throne<br/>Rules heaven and earth and sea<br/>Is pleased to claim me for His own<br/>And give Himself for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His person fixes all my love<br/>His blood removes my fear<br/>And while He pleads for me above<br/>His arm preserves me here</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>His word of promise is my food<br/>His spirit is my guide<br/>Thus daily is my strength renewed<br/>And all my wants supplied</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>For Him I count as gain each loss<br/>Disgrace for Him renown<br/>Well may I glory in His cross<br/>While He prepares my crown</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Let worldlings then indulge their boast<br/>How much they gain or spend<br/>Their joys must soon give up the ghost<br/>But mine shall know no end</lines>
