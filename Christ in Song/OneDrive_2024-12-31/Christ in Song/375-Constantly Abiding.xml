    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There’s a peace in my heart that the world never gave,
A peace it cannot take away;
Tho' the trials of life may surround like a cloud,
I’ve a peace that has come there to stay!</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Constantly abiding, Jesus is mine;
Constantly abiding, rapture divine;
He never leaves me lonely, whispers, O, so kind:
“I will never leave thee,” Jesus is mine.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>All the world seemed to sing of a Savior and King,
When peace sweetly came to my heart;
Troubles all fled away and my night turned to day,
Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>This treasure I have in a temple of clay,
While here on His footstool I roam:
But He’s coming to take me some glorious day,
Over there to my heavenly home!</lines>
    </verse>
