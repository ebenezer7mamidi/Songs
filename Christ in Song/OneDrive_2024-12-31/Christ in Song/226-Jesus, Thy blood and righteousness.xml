    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness
My beauty are, my glorious dress:
â€™Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
With joy shall I lift up my head.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord, I believe the precious blood
Which at the mercy-seat of God
For ever doth for sinners plead,
For me, even for my soul, was shed.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord, I believe, were sinners more
Than sands upon the ocean shore,
You have for all a ransom paid,
For all a full atonement made.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Bold shall I stand in that great day;
For who aught to my charge shall lay?
Fully, by Thee, absolved I am
from sin and fear, from guilt and shame.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>This spotless robe the same appears
When ruined nature sinks in years:
No age can change its constant hue;
Its glory is forever new.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>O, let the dead now hear Thy voice;
Now bid Thy banished ones rejoice;
Their beauty this, their glorious dress,
Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>Thou God of power, Thou God of love,
Let the whole world Thy mercy prove:
Their beauty this, their glorious dress,
Jesus the Lord, our righteousness.</lines>
    </verse>
