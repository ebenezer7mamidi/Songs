    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus, my Lord will love me forever,
From Him no pow'r of evil can sever,
He gave His life to ransom my soul;
Now I belong to Him;</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Now I belong to Jesus,
Jesus belongs to me,
Not for the years of time alone,
But for eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Once I was lost in sin's degradation,
Jesus came down to bring me salvation,
Lifted me up from sorrow and shame,
Now I belong to Him;</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Joy floods my soul for Jesus has saved me,
Freed me from sin that long had enslaved me
His precious blood, He came to redeem,
Now I belong to Him;</lines>
