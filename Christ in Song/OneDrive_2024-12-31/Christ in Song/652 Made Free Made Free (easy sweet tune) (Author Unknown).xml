    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Made free made free O captive<br/>Bound by the law of sin<br/>The law of life in Spirit<br/>Will quicken you within<br/>And counting on the Spirit<br/>His life shall now control<br/>The member of your body<br/>The portals of your soul</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Made free made free in Jesus<br/>For crucified with him<br/>From center to circumference<br/>He breaks the power of sin<br/>No longer act in body<br/>As if it had no law<br/>His law of life must govern<br/>All that ran wild before</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Made free made free in Jesus<br/>Deep planted in His death<br/>He liberates His life pow'r<br/>And breathes His Spirit's breath<br/>Then waxing strong in spirit<br/>With force of quickening life<br/>The soul and body governed<br/>Its members cease from strife</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Made free made free in Jesus<br/>Joined to the Risen One<br/>By conflict prayer you triumph<br/>And claim His victory won<br/>Freed with His glorious freedom<br/>Above the darkness rife<br/>For now the law of sin and death<br/>Is conquered by His life</lines>
    </verse>
