    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Arise, my soul, arise!
  Shake off thy guilty fears;
  The bleeding Sacrifice
  In my behalf appears.
Before the throne my Surety stands;
My name is written on His hands.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>He ever lives above
  For me to intercede,
  His all-redeeming love,
  His precious blood to plead.
His blood was shed for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Five bleeding wounds He bears,
  Received on Calvary;
  They pour effectual prayers;
  They strongly speak for me.
Forgive him, O forgive, they cry,
Nor let that ransomed sinner die!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>The Father hears Him pray,
  His dear anointed One;
  He cannot turn away
  The presence of His Son.
His Spirit answers to the blood,
And tells me I am born of God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>My God is reconciled,
  His pardoning voice I hear;
  He owns me for His child,
  I can no longer fear.
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And Father, Abba, Father, cry.</lines>
    </verse>
