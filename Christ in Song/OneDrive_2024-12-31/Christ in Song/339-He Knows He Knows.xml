    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I know not what awaits me,
  God kindly veils my eyes,
And o’er each step of my onward way
  He makes new scenes to rise;
And every joy He sends me comes
  A sweet and glad surprise.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Where He may lead I’ll follow,
  My trust in Him repose;
And every hour in perfect peace,
  I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows”;
And every hour in perfect peace,
  I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows.”</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>One step I see before me,
  ’Tis all I need to see,
The light of heaven more brightly shines
  When earth’s illusions flee;
And sweetly through the silence comes,
  His loving, “Trust in Me!”</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, blissful lack of wisdom,
  ’Tis blessed not to know;
He holds me with His own right hand,
  And will not let me go,
And lulls my troubled soul to rest
  In Him who loves me so.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>So on I go not knowing;
	  I would not if I might;
I’d rather walk in the dark with God
  Than go alone in the light;
I’d rather walk by faith with Him
  Than go alone by sight.</lines>
    </verse>
