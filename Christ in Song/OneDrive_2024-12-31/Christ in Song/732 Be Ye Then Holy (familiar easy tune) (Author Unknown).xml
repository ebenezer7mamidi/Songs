    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Be ye than holy<br/>So the Master wills<br/>He speaketh let us hear<br/>His gracious voice<br/>Us with His holy life<br/>He daily fills<br/>So in that holiness<br/>Let us rejoice</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>These bodies then are His<br/>He doth them use<br/>So let Him use them<br/>As it seemeth good<br/>These members all are His<br/>Shall we abuse<br/>For earthly vileness<br/>Vessels cleansed with blood</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>These eyes are His - these ears<br/>These lips - this tougue<br/>They are all His far more<br/>Than they are ours<br/>Shall we pollute them with<br/>Earth's sin and wrong<br/>Or waste in vain delights<br/>These God-given powers</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>These hands are His<br/>Shall they not do His work<br/>These feet are His<br/>Let them His errands run<br/>Shall in this frame<br/>The foe of goodness lurk<br/>Shall he usurp<br/>The consecrated throne</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Upon His holy throne<br/>These members yet<br/>Shall all be seated<br/>In that day when He<br/>The head of the great unity<br/>Shall sit<br/>With them to share<br/>One common royalty</lines>
