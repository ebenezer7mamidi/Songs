    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Behold, What Love, What Boundless Love,
The Father Hath Bestowed
On Sinners Lost, That We Should Be
Now Called “The Sons Of God!”</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Behold, What Manner Of Love!
What Manner Of Love
The Father Hath Bestowed Upon Us,
That We, That We Should Be Called,
Should Be Called The Sons Of God!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>No Longer Far From Him But Now
By “Precious Blood” Made Nigh,
Accepted In The “Well Beloved,”
Near To God’s Heart We Lie.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>What We In Glory Soon Shall Be,
It Doth Not Yet Appear;
But When Our Precious Lord We See,
We Shall His Image Bear.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>With Such A Blessed Hope In View,
We Would More Holy Be,
More Like Our Risen, Glorious Lord,
Whose Face We Soon Shall See.</lines>
    </verse>
