    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We have a most glorious King<br/>The heavens He says are His throne<br/>All worlds are His mighty domain<br/>All kingdoms His scepter shall own<br/>He dwells with his people below<br/>He loves in their trials to share<br/>We dwell with the King for his work<br/>His burden we willingly bear</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'm dwelling with Jesus my King<br/>I've found where He dwells with His own<br/>I've opened the door of my heart<br/>He's made it His temple and throne<br/>Like Mary I sit at His feet<br/>Like John I recline on His breast<br/>His presence is fullness of joy<br/>His bosom is infinite rest</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I dwell with the King for His work<br/>I've part in His glorious plan<br/>To bring in His kindom to earth<br/>And tell His salvation to man<br/>The world has its work and rewards<br/>I count them but folly and loss<br/>My business is only His work<br/>My message is only His cross</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I dwell with the King for His work<br/>The work it is His and not mine<br/>He plans and prepares it for me<br/>And fills me with power divine<br/>So duty is changed to delight<br/>And prayer into praise as I sing<br/>I dwell with my King for His work<br/>And work in the strength of my King</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>We'll dwell with the King for His work<br/>And work through each day of the year<br/>Perhaps ere it passes the King<br/>In glory Himself shall appear<br/>Oh then in some closer embrace<br/>Oh then in some nobler employ<br/>We'll dwell with the King for His work<br/>In endless ineffable joy</lines>
    </verse>
