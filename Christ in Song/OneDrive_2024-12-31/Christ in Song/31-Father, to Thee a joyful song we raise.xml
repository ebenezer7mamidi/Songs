    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Father, to Thee a joyful song we raise
    With all Thine own;
And in Thy presence sound a note of praise
    To Thee alone;
Bro’t nigh, bro’t home to Thee—O wondrous grace,
That gives us now with Thine own Son our place.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>How deep the holy joy that fills that scene,
    Where love is known!
Thy love, our God and Father, now is seen,
    In Him alone;
As, in the holy calm of Thine own rest,
He leads the praise of those Thy love has blessed.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>He leads the praise! How precious to Thine ear
    The song He sings!
How precious, too, to Thee—how near, how dear
    Are those He brings
To share His place: ’twas thus that Thou didst plan;
Thou lovedst Him before the world began.</lines>
