    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come and rejoice with me!
For once my heart was poor,
And I have found a treasury
Of love, a boundless store.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Come and rejoice with me!
I, once so sick at heart,
Have met with One who knows my case,
And knows the healing art.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Come and rejoice with me!
For I was wearied sore,
And I have found a mighty arm
Which holds me evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come and rejoice with me!
My feet so wide did roam,
And One has brought me from afar,
To find in Him my home.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Come and rejoice with me!
For I have found a Friend
Who knows my heartâ€™s most secret depths,
Yet loves me without end.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>I knew not of His love;
And He had loved so long,
With love so faithful and so deep,
So tender and so strong.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>And now I know it all,
Have heard and known His voice,
And hear it still from day to day.
Can I enough rejoice?</lines>
    </verse>
