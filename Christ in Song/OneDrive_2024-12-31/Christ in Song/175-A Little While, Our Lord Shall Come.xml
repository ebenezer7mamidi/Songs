    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>"A little while!"- our Lord shall come,
And we shall wander here no more;
He’ll take us to our Father’s home,
Where He for us has gone before,
To dwell with Him, to see His face,
And sing the glories of His grace.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>"A little while!"- He’ll come again;
Let us the precious hours redeem;
Our only grief to give Him pain,
Our joy to serve and follow Him;
Watching and ready may we be,
As those who long their Lord to see.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>"A little while!"- ’twill soon be past;
Why should we shun the shame and cross?
O let us in His footsteps haste,
Counting for Him all else but loss;
O how will recompense His smile
The sufferings of this little while!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>"A little while!"- come, Savior, come!
For Thee Thy bride has tarried long;
Take Thy poor wearied pilgrims home,
To sing the new eternal song,
To see Thy glory and to be
In everything conformed to Thee!</lines>
    </verse>
