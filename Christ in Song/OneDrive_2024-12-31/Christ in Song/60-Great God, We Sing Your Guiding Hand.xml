    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Great God, we sing that mighty hand
by which supported still we stand;
the opening year thy mercy shows;
that mercy crowns it till it close.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>By day, by night, at home, abroad,
still are we guarded by our God;
by his incessant bounty fed,
by his unerring counsel led.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>With grateful hearts the past we own;
the future, all to us unknown,
we to thy guardian care commit,
and peaceful leave before thy feet.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>In scenes exalted or depressed,
thou art our joy, and thou our rest;
thy goodness all our hopes shall raise,
adored through all our changing days.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>When death shall interrupt these songs,
and seal in silence mortal tongues,
our helper God, in whom we trust,
shall keep our souls and guard our dust.</lines>
    </verse>
