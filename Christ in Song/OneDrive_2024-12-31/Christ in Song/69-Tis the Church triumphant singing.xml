    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>’Tis the Church triumphant singing,
    Worthy the Lamb;
Heav’n throughout with praises ringing,
    Worthy the Lamb.
Thrones and pow’rs before Him bending,
Odors sweet with voice ascending
Swell the chorus never ending,
    Worthy the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Every kindred, tongue and nation,
    Worthy the Lamb;
Join to sing the great salvation,
    Worthy the Lamb.
Loud as mighty thunders roaring,
Floods of mighty waters pouring,
Prostrate at His feet adoring,
    Worthy the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Harps and songs forever sounding,
    Worthy the Lamb;
Mighty grace o’er sin abounding,
    Worthy the Lamb.
By His blood He dearly bought us;
Wand’ring from the fold He sought us,
And to glory safely brought us;
    Worthy the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Sing with blest anticipation
    Worthy the Lamb;
Through the vale of tribulation,
    Worthy the Lamb.
Sweetest notes, all notes excelling,
On the theme forever dwelling,
Still untold, though ever telling,
    Worthy the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
