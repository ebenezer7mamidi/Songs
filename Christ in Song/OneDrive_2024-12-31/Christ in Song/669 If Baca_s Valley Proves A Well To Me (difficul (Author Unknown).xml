    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>If "Bacca's Valley" proves a "well" to me<br/>It is because my Father's will I see<br/>Proving that love behind each sorrow dwells<br/>And sorrow's pathway only mercy spells</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Love's pressure brings out fragrance rare and sweet<br/>Because beneath the weight Himself I meet<br/>And in the sunshine of His blessed face<br/>There flows from me some answer to His grace</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Then chastening proves the love remains the same<br/>As when it first to plough its furrows came<br/>But room is left when self is turned aside<br/>To let the fragrance of that love abode</lines>
    </verse>
