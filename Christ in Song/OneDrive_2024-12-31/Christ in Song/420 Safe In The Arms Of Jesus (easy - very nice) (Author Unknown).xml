    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Safe in the arms of Jesus<br/>Safe on His gentle breast<br/>There by His love o'er shaded<br/>Sweetly my soul doth rest<br/>Hark - 'tis a song of heaven<br/>Borne in a song to me<br/>Over the fields of glory<br/>Over the crystal sea</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Safe in the arms of Jesus<br/>Safe from corroding care<br/>Safe from the world's temptations<br/>Sin cannot harm me there<br/>Free from the blight of sorrow<br/>Free from my doubts and fears<br/>Only a few more trials<br/>Only a few more tears</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus my heart's dear Refuge<br/>Jesus has died for me<br/>Firm on the Rock of Ages<br/>Ever my trust shall be<br/>Here let me wait with patience<br/>Wait till the night is o'er<br/>Wait till I see the morning<br/>Break on the golden shore</lines>
