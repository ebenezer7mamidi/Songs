    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O what a wonderful wonderful day
Day I will never forget
After I'd wandered in darkness away
Jesus my Savior I met
O what a tender compassionate friend
He met the need of my heart
Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling
He made all the darkness depart</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Heaven came down and glory filled my soul
When at the cross the Savior made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God's fam'ly divine
Justified fully through Calvary's love
O what a standing is mine
And the transaction so quickly was made
When as a sinner I came
Took of the offer of grace
He did proffer He saved me
O praise His dear name</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Now I've a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time
I have a future in heaven for sure
There in those mansions sublime
And it's because of that wonderful day
When at the cross I believed
Riches eternal and blessings supernal
From His precious hand I received</lines>
    </verse>
