    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>	O for a thousand tongues to sing
  My great Redeemer’s praise,
The glories of my God and King,
  The triumphs of His grace.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>My gracious Master and my God,
  Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad,
  The honors of Thy name.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
  That bids our sorrows cease;
’Tis music in the sinner’s ears,
  ’Tis life, and health, and peace.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>His love my heart has captive made,
  His captive would I be,
For He was bound, and scourged and died,
  My captive soul to free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>See all your sins on Jesus laid:
The Lamb of God was slain,
His soul was once an offering made
For every soul of man.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,
your loosened tongues employ;
ye blind, behold your savior come,
and leap, ye lame, for joy.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>He breaks the power of canceled sin,
  He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean;
  His blood availed for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v8">
      <lines>So now Thy blessed Name I love,
  Thy will would e’er be mine.
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
  My Lord, they all were Thine!</lines>
    </verse>
