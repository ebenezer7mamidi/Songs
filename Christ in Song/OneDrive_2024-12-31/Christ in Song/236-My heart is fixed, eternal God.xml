    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My heart is fixed, eternal God,
  Fixed on Thee, fixed on Thee;
And my immortal choice is made,
  Christ for me, Christ for me;
He is my prophet, priest, and king,
Who did for me salvation bring,
And while I’ve breath I mean to sing,
  Christ for me, Christ for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>In Him I see the Godhead shine,
  Christ for me, Christ for me;
He is the majesty divine,
  Christ for me, Christ for me;
The Father’s well-beloved Son,
Co-partner of His royal throne,
Who bore the guilt of man alone,
  Christ for me, Christ for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Let others boast of heaps of gold,
  Christ for me, Christ for me;
His riches never can be told,
  Christ for me, Christ for me;
Your gold will waste and wear away,
Your honors perish in a day;
My portion never can decay,
  Christ for me, Christ for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>In pining sickness, or in health,
  Christ for me, Christ for me;
In deepest poverty or wealth,
  Christ for me, Christ for me;
And in that all-important day,
When I the summons must obey,
And pass from this dark world away,
  Christ for me, Christ for me.</lines>
    </verse>
