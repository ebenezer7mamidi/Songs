    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>One day when heaven was filled with His praises,
  One day when sin was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin—
  Dwelt among men, my example is He!</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;
  Buried, He carried my sins far away;
Rising, He justified freely forever:
    One day He’s coming—O glorious day!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain,
  One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected;
  Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>	One day they left Him alone in the garden,
  One day He rested, from suffering free;
Angels came down o’er His tomb to keep vigil;
  Hope of the hopeless, my Savior is He.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>	One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,
  One day the stone rolled away from the door;
Then He arose, over death He had conquered;
  Now is ascended, my Lord evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,
  One day the skies with His glory will shine;
Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;
  Glorious Savior, this Jesus is mine!</lines>
    </verse>
