    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I was a wand'ring sheep<br/>I did not love the fold<br/>I did not love my Shepherds voice<br/>I would not be controlled<br/>I was a wayward child<br/>I did not love my home<br/>I did not love my Father's voice<br/>I loved afar to roam</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Shepherd sought His sheep<br/>The Father sought His child<br/>He followed me o'er vale and hill<br/>O'er deserts waste and wild<br/>They found me nigh to death<br/>Famished and faint and lone<br/>They bound me with the bands of love<br/>He saved the wand'ring one</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus my Shepherd is<br/>'Twas He that loved my soul<br/>'Twas He that washed me in His blood<br/>'Twas He that made me whole<br/>'Twas He that sought the lost<br/>That found the wand'ring sheep<br/>'Twas He that brought me to the fold<br/>'Tis He that still doth keep</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I was a wand'ring sheep<br/>I would not be controlled<br/>But now I love my Savior's voice<br/>I love I love the fold<br/>I was a wayward child<br/>I once preferred to roam<br/>But now I love my Father's voice<br/>I love I love His home</lines>
