    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O Love divine, how sweet Thou art,
When shall I find my willing heart
  All taken up by Thee?
My thirsty spirit faints to prove
The greatness of redeeming love,
  The love of Christ to me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Stronger His love than death and hell,
Its riches are unsearchable:
  The first-born sons of light
Desire in vain its depths to see;
They cannot reach the mystery,
  The length, and breadth, and height.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>God only knows the love of God;
Oh, that it now were shed abroad
  In this poor stony heart;
For love I sigh, for love I pine;
This only portion, Lord, be mine,
  Be mine this better part.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh, that I could forever sit
Like Mary, at the Master’s feet;
  Be this my happy choice;
My only care, delight, and bliss,
My joy, my rest on earth be this,
  To hear the Bridegroom’s voice.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>O that I could, with favored John,
Recline my weary head upon
The dear Redeemer’s breast!
From care, and sin, and sorrow free,
Give me, O Lord, to find in Thee
My everlasting rest.</lines>
    </verse>
