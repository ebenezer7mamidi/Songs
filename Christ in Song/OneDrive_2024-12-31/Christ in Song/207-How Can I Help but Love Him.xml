    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Down from His splendor in glory He came
Into a world of woe,
Took on Himself all my guilt and my shameâ€“
Why should He love me so?</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>How can I help but love Him
When He loved me so?
How can I help but love Him
When He loved me so?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I am unworthy to take of His grace,
Wonderful grace so free;
Yet Jesus suffered and died in my place,
E'en for a soul like me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>He is the fairest of thousands to me,
His love is sweet and true;
Wonderful beauty in Him I now see,
More than I ever knew.</lines>
    </verse>
