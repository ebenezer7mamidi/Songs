    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Naught have I gotten but what I received;
Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed;
Boasting excluded, pride I abase;
I’m only a sinner saved by grace!</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Only a sinner saved by grace!
Only a sinner saved by grace!
This is my story, to God be the glory,
  I’m only a sinner saved by grace!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart,
Causing my footsteps from God to depart;
Jesus hath found me, happy my case;
I now am a sinner saved by grace!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Tears unavailing, no merit had I;
Mercy had saved me, or else I must die;
Sin had alarmed me, fearing God’s face;
But now I’m a sinner saved by grace!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows,
Loving his Savior to tell what he knows;
Once more to tell it, would I embrace—
I’m only a sinner saved by grace!</lines>
    </verse>
