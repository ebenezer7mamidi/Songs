    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Far Away In The Depth Of My Spirit Tonight
Rolls A Melody Sweeter Than Psalm;
In Celestial-Like Strains It Unceasingly Falls
Over My Soul Like An Infinite Calm.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Peace! Peace! Wonderful Peace,
Coming Down From The Father Above;
Sweep Over My Spirit Forever, I Pray,
In Fathomless Billows Of Love.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>What A Treasure I Have In This Wonderful Peace,
Buried Deep In The Heart Of My Soul;
So Secure That No Power Can Mine It Away,
While The Years Of Eternity Roll.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I Am Resting Tonight In This Wonderful Peace,
Resting Sweetly In Jesus’ Control;
For I’m Kept From All Danger By Night And By Day,
And His Glory Is Flooding My Soul.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>And I think When I Rise To That City Of Peace,
Where The Author Of Peace I Shall See.
That One Strain Of The Song Which The Ransomed Will Sing,
In That Heavenly Kingdom Shall Be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>O my Soul, Are You Here Without Comfort And Rest,
Marching Down The Rough Pathway Of Time?
Make Jesus Your Friend Ere The Shadows Grow Dark;
O Accept This Sweet Peace So Sublime</lines>
    </verse>
