    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In loving-kindness Jesus came
  My soul in mercy to reclaim,
And from the depths of sin and shame
  Through grace He lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>From sinking sand He lifted me,
With tender hand He lifted me,
From shades of night to plains of light,
  Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>He called me long before I heard,
  Before my sinful heart was stirred,
But when I took Him at His word,
  Forgiv’n, He lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>His brow was pierced with many a thorn,
  His hands by cruel nails were torn,
When from my guilt and grief, forlorn,
  In love He lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Now on a higher plane I dwell,
  And with my soul I know ’tis well;
Yet how or why, I cannot tell,
  He should have lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>
