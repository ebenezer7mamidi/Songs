    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh to be nothing nothing<br/>Only to lie at His feet<br/>A broken and emptied vessel<br/>For the Master's use made meet<br/>Emptied that He might fill me<br/>As forth to His service I go<br/>Broken that so unhinder'd<br/>His life through me might flow</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh to be nothing nothing<br/>Only as led by His hand<br/>A messenger at His gateway<br/>Only waiting for His command<br/>Only an instrument ready<br/>His praises to sound at His will<br/>Willing should He not require me<br/>In silence to wait on Him still</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh to be nothing nothing<br/>Painful the humbling may be<br/>Yet low in the dust I'd lay me<br/>That the world might my Savior see<br/>Rather be nothing nothing<br/>To Him let their voices be raised<br/>He is the fountain of blessing<br/>He only is meet to be praised</lines>
