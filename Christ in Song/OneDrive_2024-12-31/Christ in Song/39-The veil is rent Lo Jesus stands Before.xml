    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The veil is rent: Lo! Jesus stands
Before the throne of grace;
And clouds of incense from His hands
Fill all that glorious place.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>His precious blood is sprinkled there,
Before and on the throne;
And His own wounds
in heaven declare
His work that saves is done.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>“‘Tis finished!” on the Cross He said,
In agonies and blood;
‘Tis finished! now He lives to plead
Before the face of God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>‘Tis finished! here our souls can rest,
His work can never fail;
By Him, our Sacrifice and Priest,
We enter through the veil.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Within the holiest of all,
Cleansed by His precious blood,
Before Thy throne Thy children fall,
And worship Thee, our God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Boldly our heart and voice we raise,
His Name, His blood, our plea;
Assured our prayers
and songs of praise
Ascend by Him to Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
