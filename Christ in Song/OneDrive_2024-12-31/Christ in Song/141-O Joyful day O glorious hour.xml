    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O Joyful day! O glorious hour!
When Jesus, by almighty power,
Revived and left the grave;
In all His works behold Him great,
Before, almighty to create,
Before, almighty to create,
Almighty now to save.
</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>The First-begotten from the dead,
He's risen now, His people's Head,
And thus their life's secure;
And if, like Him, they yield their breath,
Like Him they'll burst the bonds of death,
Like Him they'll burst the bonds of death,
Their resurrection sure.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Why should His people,then, be sad?
None have such reason to be glad
As those redeemed to God:
Jesus, the mighty Saviour, lives,
To them eternal life He gives,
To them eternal life He gives,
The purchase of His blood.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Then let our gladsome praise resound,
And let us in His work abound,
Whose blessed name is Love;
We're sure our labour's not in vain,
For we with Him ere long shall reign-
For we with Him ere long shall reign-
With Jesus dwell above.</lines>
    </verse>
