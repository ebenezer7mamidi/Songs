    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Down from His glory,
  Ever living story,
My God and Savior came,
  And Jesus was His name.
Born in a manger,
  To His own a stranger,
A Man of sorrows, tears and agony.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O how I love Him! How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, my all in all!
The great Creator became my Savior,
  And all God’s fulness dwelleth in Him.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>What condescension,
  Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night,
  Not one faint hope in sight,
God, gracious, tender,
  Laid aside His splendor,
Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Without reluctance,
  Flesh and blood His substance
He took the form of man,
  Revealed the hidden plan.
O glorious myst’ry,
  Sacrifice of Calv’ry,
And now I know Thou art the great “I AM.”</lines>
    </verse>
