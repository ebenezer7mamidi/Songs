    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I'm not ashamed to own my Lord,
or to defend his cause,
maintain the honor of his Word,
the glory of his cross.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus, my God! I know his name,
his name is all my trust;
nor will he put my soul to shame,
nor let my hope be lost.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Firm as his throne his promise stands,
and he can well secure
what I've committed to his hands
'til the decisive hour.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Then will he own my worthless name
before his Father's face,
and in the new Jerusalem
appoint my soul a place.</lines>
    </verse>
