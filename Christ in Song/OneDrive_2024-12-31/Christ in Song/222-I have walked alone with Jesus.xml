    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have walked alone with Jesus
In a fellowship divine.
Never more can earth allure me,
I am His and He is mine.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I have seen Him, I have known Him,
For He deigns to walk with me;
And the glory of His presence will be mine eternally.
O the glory of His presence, O the beauty of His face;
I am His and His forever, He has won me by His grace.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>On the mountain I have seen Him,
Christ my Comforter and Friend
And the glory of His presence
Will be with me to the end.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>In my failure, sin, and sorrow,
Broken-hearted, crushed and torn,
I have felt His presence near me,
He has all my burdens borne.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>In the darkness, in the shadow,
With the Saviour I have trod,
Sweet indeed have been the lessons
Since Iâ€™ve walked alone with God.</lines>
    </verse>
