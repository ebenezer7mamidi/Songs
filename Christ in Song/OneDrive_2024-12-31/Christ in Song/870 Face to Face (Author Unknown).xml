    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Face to face with Christ, my Savior,<br/>Face to face- what will it be?<br/>When with rapture I behold Him,<br/>Jesus Christ who died for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Face to face I shall behold Him,<br/>Far beyond the starry sky;<br/>Face to face in all His glory,<br/>I shall see Him by and by!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Only faintly now, I see Him,<br/>With the darkling veil between,<br/>But a blessed day is coming,<br/>When His glory shall be seen.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>What rejoicing in His presence,<br/>When are banished grief and pain;<br/>When the crooked ways are straightened,<br/>And the dark things shall be plain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Face to face! O blissful moment!<br/>face to face- to see and know;<br/>face to face with my Redeemer,<br/>Jesus Christ who loves me so.</lines>
    </verse>
