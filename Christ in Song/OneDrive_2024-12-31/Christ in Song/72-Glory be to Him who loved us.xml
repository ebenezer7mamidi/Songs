    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Glory be to Him who loved us,
Washed us from each sinful stain;
Glory be to Him who made us
Priests and kings with Him to reign;
Glory, worship, laud and blessing
To the Lamb who once was slain.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Glory, worship, laud and blessing,
Thus the choir triumphant sings;
Honor, riches, power, dominion,
Thus its praise creation brings;
Thou art worthy, Thou art worthy,
Lord of lords, and King of kings.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Glory to the King of angels,
Glory to the Churchâ€™s King,
Glory to the King of nations,
Heaven and earth His praises sing;
Glory ever and forever
To the King of Glory bring.</lines>
    </verse>
