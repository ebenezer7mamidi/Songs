    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In heavenly love abiding,
No change my heart shall fear;
And safe is such confiding,
For nothing changes here.
The storm may roar without me,
My heart may low be laid;
But God is round about me,
And can I be dismayed?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Wherever He may guide me,
No want shall turn me back;
My Shepherd is besided me,
And nothing can I lack.
His wisdom ever waketh,
His sight is never dim;
He knows the way He taketh,
And I will walk with Him.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Green pastures are before me,
Which yet I have not seen;
Bright skies will soon be oâ€™er me,
Where darkest clouds have been.
My hope I cannot measure,
My path to life is free;
My Savior has my tea sure,
And He will walk with me.</lines>
    </verse>
