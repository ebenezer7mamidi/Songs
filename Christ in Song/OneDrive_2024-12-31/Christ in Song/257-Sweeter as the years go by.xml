    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Of Jesus’ love that sought me,
  When I was lost in sin;
Of wondrous grace that brought me
  Back to His fold again;
Of heights and depths of mercy,
  Far deeper than the sea,
And higher than the heavens,
  My theme shall ever be.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Sweeter as the years go by,
Sweeter as the years go by;
Richer, fuller, deeper,
Jesus’ love is sweeter,
  Sweeter as the years go by.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>He trod in old Judea
  Life’s pathway long ago;
The people thronged about Him,
  His saving grace to know.
He healed the broken-hearted,
  And caused the blind to see;
And still His great heart yearneth
  In love for even me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>’Twas wondrous love which led Him
	  For us to suffer loss-
To bear without a murmur 
The anguish of the cross;
With saints redeemed in glory, 
Let us our voices raise,
Till Heav’n and earth re-echo 
With our Redeemer’s praise.</lines>
    </verse>
