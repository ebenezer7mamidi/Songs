      <lines>I have a Saviour<br/>He's pleading in glory<br/>A dear loving Saviour<br/>Though earth friends be few<br/>And now He is watching<br/>In tenderness o'er me<br/>But oh that my Saviour<br/>Were your Saviour too</lines>
    </verse>

    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I have a Father<br/>To me He has given<br/>A hope for eternity<br/>Blessed and true<br/>And soon will He call me<br/>To meet Him in heaven<br/>But oh that He'd let me<br/>Bring you with me too</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I have a peace<br/>It is calm as a river<br/>A peace that the friends<br/>Of this world never knew<br/>My Saviour alone is<br/>It's Author and Giver<br/>And oh could I know<br/>It was given to you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When Jesus has found you<br/>Tell others the story<br/>That my loving Savior<br/>Is your Savior too<br/>Then pray that your Savior<br/>May bring them to glory<br/>And prayer will be answered<br/>'twas answered for you</lines>
