    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My heart is resting, O my God,
  I will give thanks and sing;
My heart is at the secret source
  Of every precious thing.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
  I daily, hourly sing;
My heart is at the secret source
    Of every precious thing.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now this frail vessel Thou hast made,
  No hand but Thine shall fill;
The waters of the earth have failed,
  And I am thirsty still.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I thirst for springs of heavenly life,
  And here all day they rise;
I seek the treasure of Thy love,
  And close at hand it lies.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>A glad, new song is in my mouth,
  To long-loved music set,
A song of praise for all the grace
  I have not tasted yet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I have a heritage of joy
  That yet I must not see;
The hand that bled to make it mine
  Is keeping it for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>There is a certainty of love
  That sets my heart at rest;
A calm assurance for today
  That to be poor is best.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>A prayer reposing on His truth,
  Who hath made all things mine;
That draws my captive will to Him,
  And makes it one with Thine.</lines>
    </verse>
