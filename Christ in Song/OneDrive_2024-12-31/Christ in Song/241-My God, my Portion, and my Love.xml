    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My God, my Portion, and my Love,
  My everlasting All,
I’ve none but Thee in heav’n above,
  Or on this earthly ball,
  Or on this earthly ball.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>What empty things are all the skies,
  And this inferior clod!
There’s nothing here deserves my joys,
  There’s nothing like my God,
  There’s nothing like my God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends,
  And health, and safe abode;
Thanks to Thy name for meaner things,
  But they are not my God,
  But they are not my God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>How vain a toy is glittering wealth,
  If once compared to Thee!
Or what’s my safety, or my health,
  Or all my friends to me,
  Or all my friends to me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Were I possessor of the earth,
  And called the stars my own,
Without Thy graces and Thyself,
  I were a wretch undone,
  I were a wretch undone.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Let others stretch their arms like seas,
  And grasp in all the shore;
Grant me the visits of Thy grace,
  And I desire no more,
  And I desire no more.</lines>
    </verse>
