    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Fade, fade each earthly joy;
  Jesus is mine.
Break every tender tie;
  Jesus is mine.
Dark is the wilderness,
Earth has no resting place,
Jesus alone can bless;
  Jesus is mine.</lines>
    </verse>  
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Tempt not my soul away;
  Jesus is mine.
Here would I ever stay;
  Jesus is mine.
Perishing things of clay,
Born but for one brief day,
Pass from my heart away;
  Jesus is mine.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Farewell, ye dreams of night;
  Jesus is mine.
Lost in this dawning bright;
  Jesus is mine.
All that my soul has tried
Left but a dismal void;
Jesus has satisfied;
  Jesus is mine.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Farewell, mortality;
  Jesus is mine.
Welcome, eternity;
  Jesus is mine.
Welcome, O Loved and Blest,
Welcome, sweet scenes of rest,
Welcome, my Saviorâ€™s breast;
  Jesus is mine.</lines>
    </verse>
