    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I stand amazed in the presence
  Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
  A sinner condemned, unclean.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>How marvelous! How wonderful!
  And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! How wonderful!
    Is my Savior’s love for me!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>For me it was in the garden,
  He prayed: “Not my will, but Thine.”
He had no tears for His own griefs,
  But sweat-drops of blood for mine.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>In pity angels beheld Him,
  And came from the world of light
To strengthen Him in the sorrows
  He bore for my soul that night.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>He took my sins and my sorrows,
  He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv’ry,
  And suffered, and died alone.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>When with the ransomed in glory
  His face I at last shall see,
’Twill be my joy through the ages
  To sing of His love for me.</lines>
    </verse>
