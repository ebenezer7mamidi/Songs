    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Be strong, beloved, when the storm shall rage,
Look not, like Peter, at the angry crest
Of yon great billow; foaming, seething surge
Can only drive thee to thy Savior’s breast.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>See how serene and calm, how undismayed
Thy Lord doth stand, smiling upon thy fear,
Wondering that thou dost dare to be afraid,
When He, the Lord of glory, is so near.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Thou, at His “Come,” thy little boat hast left;
See, it is tossing now beyond thy call;
Look not behind thee, look into His face,
Whose “Come” once uttered, now is past recall.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Strong be thy heart, and calm, and glad, and brave!
For angels wonder at thy fearless faith,
And Christ is glad, and men are whispering
Their thanks to God; “Be faithful, yea, to death.”</lines>
