    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I Am So Glad That Our Father In Heaven
Tells Of His Love In The Book He Has Given;
Wonderful Things In The Bible I See,
This Is The Dearest, That Jesus Loves Me.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I Am So Glad That Jesus Loves Me,
Jesus Loves Me, Jesus Loves Me.
I Am So Glad That Jesus Loves Me,
Jesus Loves Even Me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Though I Forget Him, And Wander Away,
Still He Doth Love Me Wherever I Stray;
Back To His Dear Loving Arms I Do Flee,
When I Remember That Jesus Loves Me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, If There’s Only One Song I Can Sing,
When In His Beauty I See The Great King,
This Shall My Song Through Eternity Be,
“Oh, What A Wonder That Jesus Loves Me!”</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Jesus Loves Me, And I Know I Love Him;
Love Brought Him Down My Poor Soul To Redeem;
Yes, It Was Love Made Him Die On The Tree;
Oh, I Am Certain That Jesus Loves Me!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>If One Should Ask Of Me, How Can I Tell?
Glory To Jesus, I Know Very Well!
God’s Holy Spirit With Mine Doth Agree,
Constantly Witnessing Jesus Loves Me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>In This Assurance I Find Sweetest Rest,
Trusting In Jesus, I Know I Am Blessed;
Satan, Dismayed, From My Soul Now Doth Flee,
When I Just Tell Him That Jesus Loves Me.</lines>
