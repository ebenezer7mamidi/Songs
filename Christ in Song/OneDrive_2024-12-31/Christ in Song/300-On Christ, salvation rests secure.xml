    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>On Christ, salvation rests secure;
The Rock of Ages must endure;
Nor can that faith be overthrown
Which rests upon the “Living Stone.”</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>No other hope shall intervene;
To Him we look, on Him we lean;
Other foundations we disown,
And build on Christ, the “Living Stone.”</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>In Him it is ordained to raise
A temple to Jehovah’s praise,
Composed of all His saints, who own
No Savior but the “Living Stone.”</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>View the vast building, see it rise:
The work how great! the plan how wise!
O wondrous fabric! pow’r unknown:
That rests it on the “Living Stone.”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>But most adore His precious name:
His glory and His grace proclaim!
For us, the lost, condemned, undone,
He gave Himself, the “Living Stone.”</lines>
    </verse>
