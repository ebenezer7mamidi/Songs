    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast shown,
  And I begin to see,
What Thou canst be to all Thine own,
  What they may be to Thee;
If only they will yield Thee all,
And trustingly obey Thy call.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>How wonderful! I never knew
  That I might trust Thee so;
That Thou wouldst be so much to me.
  In all the way I go,
That every need Thou wouldst supply.
And all my longings satisfy.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I take Thee as my keeper now
  And I commit to Thee
My soul, my way, my works, my cause.
  In Thy sole charge to be;
And my deposit, Thou, I know
Wilt guard secure from every foe.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>I take Thee for my peace, O Lord.
  My heart to keep and fill
Thine own great calm, amid earth’s storms
  Shall keep me always still;
And as Thy kingdom doth increase,
So shall Thine ever-deep’ning peace.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>I take Thee as my wisdom too
  For wisdom’s sum Thou art;
Thou, who dost choose the foolish things.
  Set me henceforth apart,
That I may speak and work for Thee
As Thou shalt work and speak in me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>I take Thee, Lord, to be my all.
  Since all Thou art is mine;
I nothing have, and nothing am;
  That nothing, Lord, is Thine.
Thou shalt be everything to me
In all things my sufficiency.</lines>
