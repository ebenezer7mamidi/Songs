    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Begin the day with God!
He is thy sun and day;
His is the radiance of thy dawn,
To Him commit thy way.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sing a new song at morn!
Join the glad woods and hills;
Join the fresh winds and seas and plains,
Join the bright flowers and rills.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sing thy first song to God
Not to thy fellow man;
Not to the creatures of His hand,
But to the glorious One.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Take thy first walk with God!
Let Him go forth with thee;
By stream or sea or mountain path,
Seek still His company.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Thy first transaction be
With God Himself above;
So shall thy business prosper well,
And all the day be love.</lines>
    </verse>
