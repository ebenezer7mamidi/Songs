    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A mind at perfect peace with God;
  O what a word is this!
A sinner reconciled through blood;
  This, this indeed is peace.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>By nature and by practice far,
  How very far from God;
Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him,
  Through faith in Jesus’ blood.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>So nigh, so very nigh to God,
  I cannot nearer be;
For in the person of His Son
  I am as near as He.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>So dear, so very dear to God,
  More dear I cannot be;
The love wherewith He loves the Son,
  Such is His love to me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Why should I ever anxious be,
  Since such a God is mine?
He watches o’er me night and day,
  And tells me “Mine is thine.”</lines>
    </verse>
