    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Long have I sought for happiness,
	  But where can it be found?
	  Only, dear Saviour in Thy grace,
	  Where purest joys abound.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>A moment's space without God
	  Creates in me a hell;
	  But when He sheds His love abroad,
	  What raptures do I feel!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord, if a transient sight of Thee
	  Affords us such a feast,
	  How glorious will that vision be,
	  Which shall forever last?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>When shall we, Lord, Thy glory see
	  In light without a shade,
	  The glort which surrounded Thee
	  Before the world was made?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>What cares, infirmities and pains
	  Oppress our feeble frame?
	  Immortal health and vigor reigns
	  In presence if the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>We now but darkly thro' the glass
	  Behold the God we own;
	  Then shall we see Him face to face,
	  And know as we are known.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>Then satan with his fiery darts
	  Shall us no more molest;
	  His arrows cannot reach our hearts
	  When we in glory rest.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v8">
      <lines>The world shall no more charm eyes,
	  Nor captive our hearts,
	  Our soluls to nobler pleasures rise,
	  Which God Himself imparts.</lines>
    </verse>
