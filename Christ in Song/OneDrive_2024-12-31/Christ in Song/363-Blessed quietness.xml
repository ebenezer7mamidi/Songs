    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Joys are flowing like a river,
Since the Comforter has come;
He abides with us forever,
Makes the trusting heart His home.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Blessed quietness, holy quietnessâ€”
  What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
    How the billows cease to roll!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Bringing life and health and gladness
All around, this heavenly Guest
Banished unbelief and sadness,
Changed our weariness to rest.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Like the rain that falls from heaven,
Like the sunlight from the sky,
So the Holy Ghost is given,
Coming to us from on high.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>See a fruitful field is growing
Blessed fruits of righteousness,
And the streams of life are flowing
In the lonely wilderness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>What a wonderful salvation
Where we always see His face!
What a perfect habitation!
What a quiet resting place!</lines>
    </verse>
