    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus shall reign where’er the sun
Doth his successive journeys run;
His Kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>To Him shall endless prayer be made.
And princes throng to crown His head,
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
With every morning sacrifice.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song;
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His name.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Blessings abound where’er He reigns:
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains,
The weary find eternal rest,
And all the sons of want are blest.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Where He displays His healing power
Death and the curse are known no more;
In Him the tribes of Adam boast
More blessings than their father lost.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Let every creature rise and bring
Peculiar honors to our King;
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud Amen.</lines>
    </verse>
