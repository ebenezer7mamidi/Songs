    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Down at the cross where my Savior died,
Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,
There to my sin was the blood applied;
    Glory to His name!</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name;
There to my sin was the blood applied;
    Glory to His name!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I am so wondrously saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly abides within;
There at the cross where He took me in;
    Glory to His name.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;
    Glory to His name.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come to this fountain so rich and sweet;
Cast thy poor soul at the Saviorâ€™s feet;
Plunge in today, and be made complete;
    Glory to His name.</lines>
