    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Under His wings<br/>I am safely abiding<br/>Tho the night deepens<br/>And tempest are wild<br/>Still I can trust Him<br/>I know He will keep me<br/>He has redeemed me<br/>And I am His child</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Under His wings<br/>Under His wings<br/>Who from His love can sever<br/>Under His wings<br/>My soul shall abide<br/>Safely abide forever</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Under His wings<br/>What a refuge in sorrow<br/>How the heart yearningly<br/>Turns to His rest<br/>Often when earth<br/>Has no balm for my healing<br/>There I find comfort<br/>And there I am blest</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Under His wings<br/>O what precious enjoyment<br/>There will I hide<br/>'Til life's trials are o'er<br/>Sheltered protected<br/>No evil can harm me<br/>Resting in Jesus<br/>I'm safe evermore</lines>
    </verse>
