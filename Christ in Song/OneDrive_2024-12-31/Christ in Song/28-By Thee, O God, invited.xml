    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>By Thee, O God, invited,
  We look unto the Son,
In whom Thy heart delighted,
  Who all Thy will hath done;
And by the one chief treasure
  Thy bosom freely gave,
Thine own pure love we measure,
  Thy willing mind to save.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>O God of mercy—Father!
  The one unchanging claim,
The brightest hopes, we gather
  From Christ’s most precious name:
What always sounds so sweetly
  In Thine unwearied ear,
Has freed our souls completely
  From all our guilt and fear.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>The trembling sinner feareth
  That God can ne’er forget;
But one full payment cleareth
  His memory of all debt.
When nought beside could free us,
  Or set our souls at large,
The death of God’s Beloved
  Secured a full discharge.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>No wrath God’s heart retaineth
  To usward who believe;
No dread in ours remaineth
  As we His love receive;
Returning sons He kisses,
  And with His robe invests;
His perfect love dismisses
  All terror from our breasts.</lines>
    </verse>
