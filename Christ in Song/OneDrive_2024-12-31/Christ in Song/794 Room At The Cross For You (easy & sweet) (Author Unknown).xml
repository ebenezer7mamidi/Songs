    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The cross upon which Jesus died<br/>Is a shelter in which we can hide<br/>And its grace so free is sufficient for me<br/>And deep is its fountain as wide as the sea</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>There's room at the cross for you<br/>There's room at the cross for you<br/>Though millions have come<br/>There's still room for one<br/>Yes there's room at the cross for you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Though millions have found Him a friend<br/>And have turned from the sins they have sinned<br/>The Savior still waits to open the gates<br/>And welcome a sinner before it's too late</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The hand of my Savior is strong<br/>And the love of my Savior is long<br/>Through sunshine or rain through loss or in gain<br/>The blood flows from Calvary to cleanse every stain</lines>
    </verse>
