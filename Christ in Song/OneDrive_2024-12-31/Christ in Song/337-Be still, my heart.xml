    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Be still, my heart! these anxious cares
To thee are burdens, thorns and snares;
They cast dishonor on the Lord,
And contradict His gracious word.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Brought safely by His hand thus far,
Why wilt thou now give place to fear?
How canst thou want if He provide,
Or lose thy way with such a Guide?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>When first before His mercy-seat
Thou didst to Him thine all commit;
He gave thee warrant from that hour
To trust His wisdom, love, and power.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Did ever trouble yet befall,
And He refuse to hear thy call?
And has He not His promise passed,
That thou shalt overcome at last?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He who has helped me hitherto
Will help me all my journey through,
And give me daily cause to raise
New Ebenezers to His praise.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Though rough and thorny be the road,
It leads thee on, apace, to God;
Then count thy present trials small,
For God will make amends for all.</lines>
    </verse>
