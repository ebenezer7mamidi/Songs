    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>This is my wonderful story,
  Christ to my heart has come;
Jesus, the King of Glory,
  Finds in my heart a home.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Christ in me, Christ in me,
Christ in me, O wonderful story,
Christ in me, Christ in me,
  Christ in me, the hope of glory.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Was there e’er story so moving,
  Story of love and pain;
Was there e’er Bridegroom so loving,
  Seeking our hearts to gain.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I am so glad I received Him,
  Jesus my heart’s dear King;
I who so often have grieved Him,
  All to His feet would bring.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>How can I ever be lonely,
  How can I ever fall;
What can I want, if only
  Christ is my all in all?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Now in His bosom confiding,
  This my glad song shall be;
I am in Christ abiding,
  And Christ abides in me.</lines>
