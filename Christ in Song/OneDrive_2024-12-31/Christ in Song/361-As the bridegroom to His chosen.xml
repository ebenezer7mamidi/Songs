    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As the bridegroom to His chosen,
As the king unto the realm,
As the keep unto the castle,
As the pilot to the helm,
So, Lord, art Thou to me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>As the fountain in the garden,
As the candle in the dark,
As the treasure in the coffer,
As the manna in the ark.
So, Lord, art Thou to me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>As the music at the banquet
As the stamp unto the seal,
As the medâ€™cine to the fainting,
As the wine-cup at the meal,
So, Lord, art Thou to me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>As the ruby in the setting,
As the honey in the comb,
As the light within the lantern,
As the father in the home,
So, Lord, art Thou to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>As the sunshine in the heavens,
As the image in the glass,
As the fruit unto the fig tree,
As the dew unto the grass,
So, Lord, art Thou to me.</lines>
    </verse>
