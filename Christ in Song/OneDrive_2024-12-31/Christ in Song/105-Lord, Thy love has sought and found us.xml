    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, Thy love has sought and found us
  Wand’ring in this desert wide;
Thou hast thrown Thine arms around us,
  For us suffered, bled, and died.
Sing, my soul! He loved thee,
Jesus gave Himself for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Hark! what sounds of bitter weeping
  From yon lonesome garden sweep;
’Tis the Lord His vigil keeping,
  While His followers sink in sleep.
Ah, my soul, He loved thee,
Yes, He gave Himself for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>He is speaking to His Father,
  Tasting deep that bitter cup,
Yet He takes it, willing rather
  For our sakes to drink it up.
Oh, what love! He loved me!
Gave Himself, my soul, for thee.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Then that closing scene of anguish:
  All God’s waves and billows roll
Over Him, there left to languish
  On the cross, to save my soul.
Matchless love! how vast, how free,
Jesus gave Himself for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Hark again! His cries are waking
  Echoes on dark Calvary’s hill;
God, my God, art Thou forsaking
  Him who always did Thy will?
Ah, my soul! it was for thee,
Yes! He gave Himself for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Lord, we joy, Thy toils are ended,
  Glad Thy suff’ring time is o’er;
To Thy Father’s throne ascended,
  There Thou liv’st, to die no more.
Yes, my soul, He lives for thee,
He who gave Himself for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>Lord, we worship and adore Thee
  For Thy rich, Thy matchless grace;
Perfect soon in joy before Thee,
  We shall see Thee face to face.
Yet e’en now our song shall be,
Jesus gave Himself for me.</lines>
