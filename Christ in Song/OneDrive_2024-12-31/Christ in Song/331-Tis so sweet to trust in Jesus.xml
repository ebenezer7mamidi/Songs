    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>’Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take Him at His word;
Just to rest upon His promise;
Just to know, Thus saith the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him,
How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er,
Jesus, Jesus, Precious Jesus!
  O for grace to trust Him more.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood;
Just in simple faith to plunge me,
’Neath the healing, cleansing flood.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life, and rest, and joy, and peace.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee,
Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;
And I know that Thou art with me,
Wilt be with me to the end.</lines>
    </verse>
