    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I’ve turned my back upon the world
  With all its idle pleasures,
And set my heart on better things,
  On higher, holier treasures;
No more its glitter and its glare,
  And vanity shall blind me;
I’ve crossed the separating line,
  And left the world behind me.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Far, far behind me!
  Far, far behind me!
I’ve crossed the separating line,
  And left the world behind me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I’ve left the old sad life of sin,
  Its follies all forsaken;
My standing place is now in Christ,
  His holy vows I’ve taken;
Beneath the standard of the cross
  The world henceforth shall find me;
I’ve passed in Christ from death to life,
  And left the world behind me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="c2">
      <lines>Far, far behind me!
  Far, far behind me!
I’ve passed in Christ from death to life,
    And left the world behind me.</lines>
    </verse>	
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>My soul shall ne’er return again
  Back to its former station
For here alone is perfect peace,
  And rest from condemnation;
I’ve made exchange of masters now,
  The vows of glory bind me,
And once for all I’ve left the world,
  Yes, left the world behind me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="c3">
      <lines>Far, far behind me!
  Far, far behind me!
And once for all I’ve left the world,
    Yes, left the world behind me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>My choice is made forevermore,
  I want no other Savior;
I ask no purer happiness
  Than His sweet love and favor;
My heart is fixed on Jesus Christ,
  No more the world shall blind me;
I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death,
  And left the world behind me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="c4">
      <lines>Far, far behind me!
  Far, far behind me!
I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death,
  And left the world behind me.</lines>
