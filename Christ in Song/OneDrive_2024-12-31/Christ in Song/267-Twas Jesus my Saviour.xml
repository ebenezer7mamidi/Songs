    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>‘Twas Jesus, my Saviour,
who died on the tree,
To open a fountain
for sinners like me;
His blood is that fountain
which pardon bestows,
And cleanses the foulest
wherever it flows.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>For the lion of Judah
shall break every chain,
And give us the vict’ry,
again and again.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>And when I was willing
with all things to part,
He gave me His blessing,
His love in my heart;
So now I am joined
with the conquering band
Who are marching
to glory at Jesus’ command.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Though round me the storms
of adversity roll,
And the waves of destruction
encompass my soul;
In vain this frail vessel
the tempest shall toss—
My hope is secure
through the blood of the cross.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>And when with the ransomed,
by Jesus, my Head,
From fountain to fountain
I then shall be led;
I’ll fall at His feet
and His mercy adore,
And sing Hallelujah
to God evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
