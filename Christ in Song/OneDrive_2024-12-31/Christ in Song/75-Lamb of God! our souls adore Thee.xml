    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lamb of God! our souls adore Thee,
  While upon Thy face we gaze;
There the Father’s love and glory
  Shine in all their brightest rays;
Thine Almighty pow’r and wisdom
  All creation’s works proclaim;
Heav’n and earth alike confess Thee
  As the ever great “I AM.”</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Son of God! Thy Father's bosom
Ever was Thy dwelling-place;
His delight, in Him rejoicing,
One with Him in power and grace:
O what wondrous love and mercy!
Thou didst lay Thy glory by,
And for us didst come from heaven
As the Lamb of God to die.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lamb of God! When we behold Thee
Lowly in the manger laid,
Wandering as a homeless stranger
In the world Thy hands had made;
When we see Thee in the garden,
In Thine agony of blood,
At Thy grace we are confounded,
Holy, spotless, Lamb of God!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>When we see Thee, as the victim,
  Bound to the accursed tree,
For our guilt and folly stricken,
  All our judgment borne by Thee,
Lord, we own, with hearts adoring,
  Thou hast loved us unto blood;
Glory, glory everlasting
  Be to Thee, Thou Lamb of God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Lamb of God! Thou now art seated
High upon Thy Father's throne,
All Thy gracious work completed,
All Thy mighty victory won.
Every knee in heaven is bending
To the Lamb for sinners slain;
Every voice and heart is swelling,
"Worthy is the Lamb to reign."</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Lamb of God, Thou soon in glory
  Wilt to this sad earth return;
All Thy foes shall quake before Thee,
  All that now despise Thee mourn;
Then Thy saints all gathered to Thee,
  With Thee in Thy kingdom reign;
Thine the praise and Thine the glory,
  Lamb of God, for sinners slain!</lines>
    </verse>
