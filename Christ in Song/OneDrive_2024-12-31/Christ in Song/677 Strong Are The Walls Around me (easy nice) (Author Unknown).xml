    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Strong are the walls around me<br/>That hold me all the day<br/>But they who thus have bound me<br/>Cannot keep God away<br/>My very dungeon walls are dear<br/>Because the God I love is here</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>They know who thus oppress me<br/>'Tis hard to be alone<br/>But know not One can bless me<br/>Who comes through bars and stone<br/>He makes my dungeon's darkness bright<br/>And fills my bosom with delight</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Thy love O God restores me<br/>From sighs and tears to praise<br/>And deep my soul adores Thee<br/>Nor thinks of time or place<br/>I ask no more in good or ill<br/>But union with Thy holy will</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>'Tis that which makes my treasure<br/>'Tis that which brings my gain<br/>Converting woe to pleasure<br/>And reaping joy from pain<br/>Oh 'tis enough whate'er befall<br/>To know that God is All in all</lines>
    </verse>
