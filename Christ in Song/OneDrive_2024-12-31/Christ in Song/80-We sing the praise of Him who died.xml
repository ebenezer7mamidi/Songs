    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We sing the praise of him who died,
of him who died upon the cross;
the sinner's hope let men deride,
for this we count the world but loss.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Inscribed upon the cross we see
in shining letters, 'God is love';
he bears our sins upon the tree;
he brings us mercy from above.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>The cross! It takes our guilt away:
it holds the fainting spirit up;
it cheers with hope the gloomy day,
and sweetens every bitter cup.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>It makes the coward spirit brave,
and nerves the feeble arm for fight;
it takes its terror from the grave,
and gilds the bed of death with light:</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>The balm of life, the cure of woe,
the measure and the pledge oflove,
the sinner's refuge here below,
the angels' theme in heaven above.</lines>
    </verse>
