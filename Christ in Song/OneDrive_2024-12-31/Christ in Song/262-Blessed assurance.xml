    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine;
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long.
This is my story, this is my song,
  Praising my Savior all the day long.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Savior am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.</lines>
    </verse>
