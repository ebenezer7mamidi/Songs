    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When my lifework is ended<br/>And I cross the swelling tide<br/>When the bright and glorious morning<br/>I shall see<br/>I shall know my Redeemer<br/>When I reach the other side<br/>And His smile will be<br/>The first to welcome me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>I shall know Him<br/> I shall know<br/>I shall know Him<br/>And redeemed by His side<br/>I shall stand<br/>I shall know Him<br/> I shall know<br/>I shall know Him<br/>By the print of the nails<br/>In His hands</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh the soul-thrilling rapture<br/>When I view His blessed face<br/>And the luster of His kindly beaming eye<br/>How my full heart will praise Him<br/>For the mercy love and grace<br/>That prepare for me<br/>A mansion in the sky</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>I shall know Him<br/> I shall know<br/>I shall know Him<br/>And redeemed by His side<br/>I shall stand<br/>I shall know Him<br/> I shall know<br/>I shall know Him<br/>By the print of the nails<br/>In His hands</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh the dear ones in glory<br/>How they beckon me to come<br/>And our parting<br/>At the river I recall<br/>To the sweet vales of Eden<br/>They will sing my welcome home<br/>But I long to meet<br/>My Savior first of all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Through the gates to the city<br/>In a robe of spotless white<br/>He will lead me<br/>Where no tears will ever fall<br/>In the glad song of ages<br/>I shall mingle with delight<br/>But I long to meet<br/>My Savior first of all</lines>
    </verse>
