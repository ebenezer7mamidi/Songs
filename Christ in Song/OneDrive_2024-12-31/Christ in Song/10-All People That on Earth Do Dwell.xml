    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All people that on earth do dwell,
sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
Serve him with joy, his praises tell,
come now before him and rejoice!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Know that the Lord is God indeed;
he formed us all without our aid.
We are the flock he comes to feed,
the sheep who by his hand were made.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>O enter then his gates with joy,
within his courts his praise proclaim.
Let thankful songs your tongues employ.
O bless and magnify his name.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>For why? the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is forever sure.
His faithfulness at all times stood
and shall from age to age endure.</lines>
    </verse>
