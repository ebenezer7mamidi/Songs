    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Ho, Every One That Is Thirsty In Spirit,
Ho, Every One That Is Weary And Sad;
Come To The Fountain, There’s Fullness In Jesus,
All That You’re Longing For, Come And Be Glad.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>‘I Will Pour Water On Him That Is Thirsty,
I Will Pour Floods Upon The Dry Ground;
Open Your Heart For The Gift I Am Bringing;
While Ye Are Seeking Me, I Will Be Found.’</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Child Of The World, Are You Tired Of Your Bondage?
Weary Of Earth-Joys, So False, So Untrue?
Thirsting For God And His Fullness Of Blessing?
List To The Promise, A Message For You!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Child Of The Kingdom, Be Filled With The Spirit!
Nothing But Fullness Thy Longing Can Meet:
This The Enduement For Life And For Service;
Thine Is The Promise, So Certain, So Sweet</lines>
    </verse>
