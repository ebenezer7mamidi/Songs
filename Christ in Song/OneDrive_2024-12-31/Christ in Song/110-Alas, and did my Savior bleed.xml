    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Alas, and did my Savior bleed?
  And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
  For such a worm as I?</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>At the cross, at the cross where
  I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
It was there by faith I received my sight,
  And now I am happy all the day!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Was it for sins that I had done
  He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
  And love beyond degree!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Well might the sun in darkness hide,
  And shut His glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
  For man, His creature’s sin.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thus might I hide my blushing face
  While His dear cross appears.
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
  And melt mine eyes to tears.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>But drops of grief can ne’er repay
  The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
  ’Tis all that I can do.</lines>
    </verse>
