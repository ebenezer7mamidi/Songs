    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We are never, never weary of the grand old song;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We can sing it loud as ever, with our faith more strong;
Glory to God, hallelujah!</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O, the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing,
For the way is growing bright, and our souls are on the wing;
We are going by and by to the palace of a King!
Glory to God, hallelujah!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>We are lost amid the rapture of redeeming love
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We are rising on its pinions to the hills above:
Glory to God, hallelujah!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>We are going to a palace that is built of gold;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
Where the King in all His splendor we shall soon behold
Glory to God, hallelujah!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>There we’ll shout redeeming mercy in a glad, new song;
Glory to God, hallelujah!
There we’ll sing the praise of Jesus with the blood washed throng;
Glory to God, hallelujah!</lines>
    </verse>
