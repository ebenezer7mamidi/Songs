    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>She only touched the hem of His garment
  As to His side she stole,
Amid the crowd that gathered around Him;
  And straightway she was whole.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh, touch the hem of His garment,
  And thou, too, shalt be free!
His healing pow’r this very hour
    Shall give new life to thee!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>She came in fear and trembling before Him,
  She knew her Lord had come,
She felt that from Him virtue had healed her,
  The mighty deed was done.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>He turned with “Daughter, be of good comfort,
  Thy faith hath made thee whole”;
And peace that passeth all understanding
  With gladness filled her soul.</lines>
    </verse>
