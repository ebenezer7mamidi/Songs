    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've found the pearl of greatest price,
My heart doth sing for joy:
And sing I must, a Christ I have;
O what a Christ have I?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Christ is my prophet, priest and king,
A Prophet full of light,
A Priest that stands 'twixt God and man,
A King that rules with might.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>My Christ he is the Lord of lords,
He is the King of kings;
He is the Sun of righteousness,
With healing in his wings.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>My Christ, he is the Tree of Life,
Which in God's garden grows;
Whose fruit does feed, whose leaves do heal;
My Christ is Sharon's rose.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Christ is my meat, Christ is my drink,
My medicine and my health,
My peace, my strength, my joy, my crown,
My glory and my wealth.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Christ is my father, and my friend,
My brother and my love;
My head, my hope, my counselor,
My advocate above.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>My Christ, he is the Heaven of heavens,
My Christ what shall I call?
My Christ is first, my Christ is last,
My Christ is all in all.</lines>
    </verse>
