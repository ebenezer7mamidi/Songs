    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The God of Abraham praise,
Who reigns enthroned above;
Ancient of everlasting days,
And God of Love;
Jehovah, great I AM!
By earth and Heav’n confessed;
I bow and bless the sacred name
Forever blest.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>The God of Abraham praise,
At whose supreme command
From earth I rise—and seek the joys
At His right hand;
I all on earth forsake,
Its wisdom, fame, and power;
And Him my only portion make,
My shield and tower.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>He by Himself has sworn;
I on His oath depend,
I shall, on eagle wings upborne,
To Heav’n ascend.
I shall behold His face;
I shall His power adore,
And sing the wonders of His grace
Forevermore.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>The whole triumphant host
Give thanks to God on high;
'Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!'
They ever cry.
Hail, Abraham’s God, and mine!
I join the heav’nly lays
All might and majesty are Thine,
And endless praise.</lines>
    </verse>
