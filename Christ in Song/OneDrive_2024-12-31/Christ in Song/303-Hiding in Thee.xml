    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,
My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;
Alone I would perish, undone would I be;
Thou blest “Rock of Ages,” I’m hiding in Thee.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,
Thou blest “Rock of Ages,” I’m hiding in Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow’s lone hour,
In times when temptation casts o’er me its pow’r;
In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,
Thou blest “Rock of Ages,” I’m hiding in Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.</lines>
