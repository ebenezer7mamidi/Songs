    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Children of the heavenly Father
safely in his bosom gather;
nestling bird nor star in heaven
such a refuge e'er was given.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>God his own shall tend and nourish;
in his holy courts they flourish.
From all evil powers he spares them;
in his mighty arms he bears them.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Neither life nor death shall ever
from the Lord his children sever;
Unto them His grace h showeth,
And their sorrows all he knoweth.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Praise the Lord in joyful numbers,
Your proteteor never slumbers;
At thew ill of your Defender
Ev'ry foe-- man must surrender.
</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Though He giveth or he taketh
God His children ne'er forsaketh;
his the loving purpose solely
to preserve them pure and holy.</lines>
    </verse>
