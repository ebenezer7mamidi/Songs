    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Art thou hung'ring for the fullness<br/>Of the blessing Christ doth give<br/>Longing now to learn the secret<br/>Of the life he bids thee live<br/>In His word thine answer standeth<br/>"Christ who is our Life" it saith<br/>Open now thy heart and trust Him<br/>There to dwell henceforth by faith</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Christ the Lord's Anointed reigning<br/>O'er the life He died to win<br/>Daily shall reveal more fully<br/>His great power without within<br/>What thou never could'st accomplish<br/>Shall His Spirit work through thee<br/>While thy soul this witness beareth<br/>'Tis not I but Christ in me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In Him dwelleth all God's fullness<br/>In Him thou art made complete<br/>Rise and claim thy heavenly birthright<br/>Kneeling at thy Father's feet<br/>He will never disappoint thee<br/>Praise Him that the gift is thine<br/>Then go forth to live each moment<br/>On sufficiency divine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lord I come and simply resting<br/>On Thy faithful changeless word<br/>I believe the blood doth cleanse me<br/>And that Christ is crowned Lord<br/>Grant henceforth a ceaseless outflow<br/>Of Thy life and love through me<br/>Reaching those who sit in darkness<br/>Winning priceless souls to Thee</lines>
