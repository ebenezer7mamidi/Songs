    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He looked for a city and lived in a tent<br/>A pilgrim to glory right onward he went<br/>God's promise his solace so royal his birth<br/>No wonder he sought not the glories of earth</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Home! Home! Home sweet home<br/>A welcome from Jesus<br/>Awaits us at Home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He looked for a city his God should prepare<br/>No mansion on earth could he covet or share<br/>For had not God told him that royal abode<br/>Awaited His pilgrims who kept to the road</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He looked for a city if sometimes he sighed<br/>To be trudging the road all earth's glory denied<br/>The thought of that city changed sighing to song<br/>For the road might be rough but it could not be long</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He looked for a city his hope Lord we share<br/>And know that bright city which Thou dost prepare<br/>We'll dwell in forever since willing to be<br/>Just pilgrims with Jesus our roof a tent tree</lines>
    </verse>
