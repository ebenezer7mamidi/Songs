    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Behold the Lamb with glory crowned,
  To Him all pow’r is giv’n:
No place too high for Him is found,
  No place too high in heav’n.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>He fills the throne—the throne above;
  Its rights to Him belong;
The object of His Father’s love,
  Theme of the ransomed’s song.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Though high yet He accepts the praise
  His people offer here;
The faintest, feeblest note they raise
  Will reach the Savior’s ear.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>This song be ours, we join in one
  To celebrate the Name
Of Him that sits upon the throne,
  And to exalt the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>To Him whom men despise and slight,
  To Him be glory giv’n;
The crown is His, and His by right
  The highest place in heav’n.</lines>
    </verse>
