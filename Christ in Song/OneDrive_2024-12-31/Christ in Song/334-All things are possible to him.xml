    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All things are possible to him
That can in Jesus’ name believe;
Lord, I no more Thy name blaspheme,
Thy truth I lovingly receive.
I can, I do believe in Thee;
All things are possible to me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>’Twas most impossible of all
That here sin’s reign in me should cease;
Yet shall it be, I know it shall;
Jesus, I trust Thy faithfulness.
If nothing is too hard for Thee,
All things are possible to me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Though earth and hell the Word gainsay,
The Word of God shall never fail;
The Lord can break sin’s iron sway;
’Tis certain, though impossible.
The thing impossible shall be,
All things are possible to me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>All things are possible to God;
To Christ, the power of God in man;
To me when I am all renewed,
In Christ am fully formed again,
And from the reign of sin set free,
All things are possible to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>All things are possible to God;
To Christ, the power of God in me;
Now shed Thy mighty Self abroad,
Let me no longer live, but Thee;
Give me this hour in Thee to prove
The sweet omnipotence of love.</lines>
    </verse>
