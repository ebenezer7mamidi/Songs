    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Many weary years I vainly sought a spring,
  One that never would run dry;
Unavailing all that earth to me could bring,
  Nothing seemed to satisfy.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,
Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;
  Finding joy and pleasure
  In abounding measure,
  I am drinking at the Fountain of life.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Through the desert land of sin I roam no more,
  For I find a living Spring
And my cup of gladness now is running oâ€™er,
  Jesus is my Lord and King.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Here is sweet contentment as the days go by,
  Here is holy peace and rest;
Here is consolation as the moments fly,
  Here my heart is always blest.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Here I find a never ending, sure supply,
  While the endless ages roll;
To this healing Fountain I would ever fly,
  There to bathe my weary soul.</lines>
    </verse>
