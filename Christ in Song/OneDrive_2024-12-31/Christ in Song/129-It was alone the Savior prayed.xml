    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It was alone the Savior prayed
  In dark Gethsemane;
Alone He drained the bitter cup
  And suffered there for me.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Alone, alone,
He bore it all alone;
He gave Himself to save His own,
  He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>It was alone the Savior stood
  In Pilateâ€™s judgment hall;
Alone the crown of thorns He wore,
  Forsaken thus by all.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Alone upon the cross He hung
  That others He might save;
Forsaken then by God and man.
  Alone, His life He gave.</lines>
    </verse>
