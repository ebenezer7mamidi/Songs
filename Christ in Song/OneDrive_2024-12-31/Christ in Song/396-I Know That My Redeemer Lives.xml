    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I know that my Redeemer lives,
And ever prays for me;
A token of His love He gives,
A pledge of liberty.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I know that my Redeemer lives,
  A quick'ning Spirit He;
I know eternal life He gives-
  Amazing grace--to me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I find Him lifting up my head;
He brings salvation near;
His presence makes me free indeed,
And He will soon appear.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>He wills that I should holy be,
What can withstand His will?
The counsel of His grace in me
He surely shall fulfill.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Jesus, I hang upon Thy word;
I steadfastly believe
Thou wilt return and claim me, Lord,
And to Thyself receive.</lines>
