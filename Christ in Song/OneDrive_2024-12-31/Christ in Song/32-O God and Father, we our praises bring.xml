    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O God and Father, we our praises bring,
  For who more worthy of our praise could be
Than Thou, who seekest worshipers who sing
  In spirit and in truth adoringly!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>All worlds Thou hast created by the Son,
  All things are held by His unmeasured power;
Yet we approach Thee in that glorious One:
  What cause for worship in this holy hour!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>â€™Tis He who leads us in this blessed sphere,
  In the assembly singing praise to Thee;
What joy to Him that we should thus be near
  As suited and in perfect liberty!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Here we unite, our song of joy is one!
  And Thou, O God, art fully satisfied.
Amidst the praises led by Christ, Thy Son,
  Thou hast a dwelling ever to abide.</lines>
    </verse>
