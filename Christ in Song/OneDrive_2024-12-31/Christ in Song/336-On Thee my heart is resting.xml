    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>On Thee my heart is resting,
  Ah, this is rest indeed:
What else, Almighty Savior,
  Can a poor sinner need?
Thy light is all my wisdom,
  Thy love is all my stay;
Thy coming back in glory,
  Draws nearer every day.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>On Thee my heart is resting,
  Ah, this is rest indeed:
What else, Almighty Savior,
    Can a poor sinner need?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>My guilt is great, but greater
  The mercy Thou dost give;
Thyself, a spotless Off’ring,
  Hast died that I should live.
With Thee, my soul unfettered
  Has risen from the dust;
Thy blood is all my treasure,
  Thy word is all my trust.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Through me, Thou gentle Master,
  Thy purposes fulfil;
I yield myself forever
  To Thy most holy will.
What though I be but weakness?
  My strength is not in me;
The poorest of Thy people
  Has all things, having Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>When clouds are darkest round me,
  Thou, Lord, art then most near,
My drooping faith to quicken,
  My weary soul to cheer.
Safe nestling in Thy bosom,
  I gaze upon Thy face;
In vain my foes would drive me
  From Thee, my hiding-place.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>’Tis Thou hast made me happy,
  ’Tis Thou hast set me free;
To whom shall I give glory
  Forever, but to Thee?
Of earthly love and blessing
  Should every stream run dry,
Thy grace shall still be with me,
  Thy grace, to live and die.</lines>
