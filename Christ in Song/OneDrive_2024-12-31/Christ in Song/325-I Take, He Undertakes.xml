    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I clasp the hand of love divine,
I claim the gracious promise mine,
And this eternal counter-sign,
"I take—He undertakes."</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I take Thee, blessèd Lord,
I give myself to Thee;
And Thou, according to Thy word,
Dost undertake for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I take salvation full and free,
Thro’ Him who gave His life for me,
He undertakes my all to be,
I take—He undertakes.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I take Him as my holiness,
My spirit’s spotless, heavenly dress,
I take the Lord, my righteousness,
I take—He undertakes.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>I take the promised Holy Ghost,
I take the power of Pentecost,
To fill me to the uttermost,
I take—He undertakes</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I take Him for this mortal frame,
I take my healing thro’ His name,
And all His risen life I claim,
I take—He undertakes.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>I simply take Him at His word,
I praise Him that my prayer is heard,
And claim my answer from the Lord,
I take—He undertakes.</lines>
    </verse>
