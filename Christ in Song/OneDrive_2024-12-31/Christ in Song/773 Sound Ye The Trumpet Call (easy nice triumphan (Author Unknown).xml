    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sound ye the trumpet call<br/>Heralds proclaim<br/>Jesus as Lord of all<br/>Sound forth His fame<br/>Tell of His great renown<br/>Lift high the kingly crown<br/>Let ev'ry knee bow down<br/>At His blest name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who will go forth for Him<br/>Who will arise<br/>Though eyes with tears are dim<br/>Severed love's ties<br/>Counting all things but loss<br/>Earth's highest gain but dross<br/>And glorying in the cross<br/>Who will arise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Go for the crowning day<br/>Draws ever near<br/>Time will soon pass away<br/>Jesus be here<br/>Raise ye the cross where now<br/>Nations to idols bow<br/>Dawn o'er the mountain's brow<br/>Tells He is near</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Hark to the trumpet-blast<br/>Jesus is King<br/>He comes to reign at last<br/>All conquering<br/>Then the wide world shall own<br/>Bending before His throne<br/>Jesus is King alone<br/>Jesus is King</lines>
