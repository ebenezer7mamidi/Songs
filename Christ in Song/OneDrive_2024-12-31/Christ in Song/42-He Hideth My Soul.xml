    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
  A wonderful Savior to me;
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
  Where rivers of pleasure I see.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
  That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
  And covers me there with His hand,
    And covers me there with His hand.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
  He taketh my burden away;
He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved,
  He giveth me strength as my day.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
  And, filled with His fulness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,
  For such a Redeemer as mine!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
  To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
  Iâ€™ll shout with the millions on high.</lines>
    </verse>
