    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Go not far from me<br/>Oh my Strength<br/>Whom all my times obey<br/>Take from me anything Thou wilt<br/>But go not Thou away<br/>And let the storm that does Thy work<br/>Deal with me as it may</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>On Thy compassion I repose<br/>In weakness and distress<br/>I will not ask for greater ease<br/>Lest I should love Thee less<br/>Oh 'tis a blessed thing for me<br/>To need Thy tenderness</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>While many sympathizing hearts<br/>For my deliverance care<br/>Thou in Thy wiser stronger love<br/>Art teaching me to bear<br/>By the sweet voice of thankful song<br/>And calm confiding prayer</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thy love has many a lighted path<br/>No outward eye can trace<br/>And my heart sees Thee in the deep<br/>With darkness on its face<br/>And communes with Thee 'mid the storm<br/>As in a secret place</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Oh Comforter of God's redeemed<br/>Who the world does not see<br/>What hand should pluck me from the flood<br/>That casts my soul on Thee<br/>Who would not suffer pain like mine<br/>To be consoled like me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>When I am feeble as a child<br/>And flesh and heart give way<br/>Then on Thy everlasting strength<br/>With passive trust I stay<br/>And the rough wind becomes a song<br/>The darkness shines like day</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Oh blessed are the eyes that see<br/>Though silent anguish show<br/>The love that in their hours of sleep<br/>Unthanked may come and go<br/>And blessed are the ears that hear<br/>Though kept awake by woe</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>Happy are they that learn in Thee<br/>Though patient suffering teach<br/>The secret of enduring strength<br/>And praise too deep for speeh<br/>Peace that no pressure from without<br/>No strife within can reach</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>There is no death for me to fear<br/>For Christ my Lord hath died<br/>There is no curse in this my pain<br/>For he was crucified<br/>And it is fellowship with Him<br/>That keeps me near His side</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>My heart is fixed O God my strength<br/>My heart is strong to bear<br/>I will be joyful in Thy love<br/>And peaceful in Thy care<br/>Deal with me for my Savior's sake<br/>According to His prayer</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>No suffering while it last is joy<br/>How blest soe'er it be<br/>Yet may the chastened child be glad<br/>His Father's face to see<br/>And oh it is not hard to bear<br/>What must be borne in Thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v12">
      <lines>It is not hard to bear by faith<br/>In Thy own bosom laid<br/>The trial of a soul redeemed<br/>For Thy rejoicing made<br/>Well may the heart in patience rest<br/>That none can make afraid</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v13">
      <lines>Safe in Thy sanctifying grace<br/>Almighty to restore<br/>Borne onward sin and death behind<br/>And love and life before<br/>O let my soul abound in hope<br/>And praise Thee more and more</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v14">
      <lines>Deep unto deep may call - but I<br/>With peaceful heart will say<br/>Thy loving-kindness hath a charge<br/>No waves can take away<br/>And let the storm that speeds me home<br/>Deal with me as it may</lines>
