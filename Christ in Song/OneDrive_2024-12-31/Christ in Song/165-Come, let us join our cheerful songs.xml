    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come, let us join our cheerful songs,
  And thus approach the throne;
Had we ten thousand thousand tongues,
  Our theme of joy’s but one:</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>“Worthy the Lamb that’s gone on high,
  To be exalted thus!”
“Worthy the Lamb that died!” we cry,
  “For He was slain for us.”</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus is worthy to receive
  Honor and pow’r divine;
And blessings more than we can give
  Be, Lord, forever Thine.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Let all that dwell above the sky,
And air, and earth, and seas,
Conspire to lift thy glories high,
And speak thine endless praise.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>The whole creation joins in one
To bless the sacred name
Of him that sits upon the throne,
And to adore the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
