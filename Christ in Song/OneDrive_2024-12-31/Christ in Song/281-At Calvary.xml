    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He died
  On Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty,
    At Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>By God’s Word at last my sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law I’d spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring turned
  To Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Now I’ve giv’n to Jesus everything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing
  Of Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan!
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span
  At Calvary!</lines>
    </verse>
