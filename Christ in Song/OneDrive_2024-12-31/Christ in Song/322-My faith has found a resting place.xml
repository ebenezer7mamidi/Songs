    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My faith has found a resting place,
  Not in device nor creed;
I trust the Ever-living One,
  His wounds for me shall plead.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I need no other argument,
  I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
    And that He died for me.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Enough for me that Jesus saves,
  This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul I come to Him,
  He’ll never cast me out.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>My heart is leaning on the Word,
  The written Word of God,
Salvation by my Savior’s name,
  Salvation through His blood.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>My great Physician heals the sick,
  The lost He came to save;
For me His precious blood He shed,
  For me His life He gave.</lines>
    </verse>
