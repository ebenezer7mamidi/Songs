    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Behold, where in a mortal form
Appears each grace divine!
The virtues, all in Jesus met,
With mildest radiance shine.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>To spread the rays of heavenly light,
To give the mourner joy,
To preach glad tidings to the poor,
Was His divine employ.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>'Midst keen reproach and cruel scorn,
Patient and meek He stood.
His foes, ungrateful, sought His life;
He labored for their good.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>In the last hours of deep distress,
Before His Father's throne,
With soul resigned He bowed, and said,
"Thy will, not mine, be done!"</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Be Christ our Pattern and our Guide!
His image may we bear!
O may we tread His holy steps,
His joys and glory share!</lines>
    </verse>
