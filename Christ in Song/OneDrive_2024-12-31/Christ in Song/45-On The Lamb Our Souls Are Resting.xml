    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>On the Lamb our souls are resting,
What His love no tongue can say;
All our sins, so great, so many,
In His blood are washed away.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sweetest rest and peace have filled us,
Sweeter praise than tongue can tell;
God is satisfied with Jesus,
We are satisfied as well.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Conscience now no more condemns us,
For His own most precious blood
Once for all has washed and cleansed us,
Cleansed us in the eyes of God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Filled with this sweet peace for ever,
On we go, through strife and care,
Till we find that peace around us
In the Lamb's high glory there.</lines>
    </verse>
