    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Father, Thy name our souls would bless,
  As children taught by grace,
Lift up our hearts in righteousness,
  And joy before Thy face.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sweet is the confidence Thou giv’st,
  Though high above our praise;
Our hearts resort to where Thou liv’st
  In heaven’s unclouded rays.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>There in the purpose of Thy love,
  Our place is now prepared,
As sons with Him who is above,
  Who all our sorrows shared.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Eternal ages shall declare
  The riches of Thy grace,
To those who with Thy Son shall share
  A son’s eternal place.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Absent as yet, we rest in hope,
  Treading the desert path,
Waiting for Him who takes us up
  Beyond the pow’r of death.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>We joy in Thee, Thy fulness shall
  Our endless portion be,
Like Thine own Son, with whom we’ll dwell
  In bright eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>O Holy Father, keep us here
  In that blest name of love,
Walking before Thee without fear,
  Thy perfect will to prove.</lines>
    </verse>
