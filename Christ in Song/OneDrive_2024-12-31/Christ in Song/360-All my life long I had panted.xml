    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All my life long I had panted
  For a draught from some cool spring,
That I hoped would quench the burning
  Of the thirst I felt within.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Hallelujah! I have found Him
Whom my soul so long has craved!
Jesus satisfies my longings;
  Through His life I now am saved.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Feeding on the husks around me,
  Till my strength was almost gone,
Longed my soul for something better,
  Only still to hunger on.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Poor I was, and sought for riches,
  Something that would satisfy,
But the dust I gathered round me
  Only mocked my soulâ€™s sad cry.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Well of water, ever springing,
  Bread of life, so rich and free,
Untold wealth that never faileth,
  My Redeemer is to me.</lines>
    </verse>
