    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O Love divine, by Christ revealed,
Incarnate Love that died for me,
To Thee myself I gladly yield,
I consecrate my all to Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>O Light divine, by Christ displayed,
Source of all light, who flesh became,
Shed Thy bright beams upon my head,
Burn in my heart a constant flame.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>O Truth divine, by Christ made known,
All truth must Thy reflection be;
Within my heart set up Thy throne,
And in Thy freedom make me free.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>O Cross divine, by Christ endured,
Thou cross on which He groaned and died,
And manâ€™s redemption thus secured,
In Thy blest shadow let me hide.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>O Peace divine, by Christ bestowed,
Thy heavenly dove to earth come down,
May He within make His abode,
My life with His dear presence crown.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>O Joy divine, by Christ possessed,
For which He did the cross endure,
Fill with Thyself and make me blest,
Contented, restful and secure.</lines>
    </verse>
