    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>If I gained the world but lost the savior<br/>Were my life worth living for a day<br/>Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort<br/>In the things that soon must pass away<br/>If I gained the world but lost the Savior<br/>Would my gain be worth the life-long strife<br/>Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing<br/>For a moment with a Christ-filled life</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Had I wealth and love in fullest measure<br/>And a name revered both far and near<br/>Yet no hope beyond no harbor waiting<br/>Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer<br/>If I gained the world but lost the Savior<br/>Who endured the cross and died for me<br/>Could then all the world afford a refuge<br/>Whither in my anguish I might flee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O what emptiness without the Savior<br/>'Mid the sins and sorrows here below<br/>And eternity how dark without Him<br/>Only night and tears and endless woe<br/>What though I might live without the Savior<br/>When I come to die how would it be<br/>O to face the valley's gloom without Him<br/>And without Him all eternity</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O the joy of having all in Jesus<br/>What a balm the broken heart to heal<br/>Ne'er a sin so great but He'll forgive it<br/>Nor a sorrow that He does not feel<br/>If I have but Jesus only Jesus<br/>Nothing else in all the world beside<br/>O then ev'rything is mine in Jesus<br/>For my needs and more He will provide</lines>
    </verse>
