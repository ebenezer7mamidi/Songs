    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Tell me the story of Jesus<br/>Write on my heart every word<br/>Tell me the story most precious<br/>Sweetest that ever was heard<br/>Tell how the angels in chorus<br/>Sang as they welcomed His birth<br/>Glory to God in the highest<br/>Peace and good tidings to earth</lines>

      <lines>Tell me the story of Jesus<br/>Write on my heart every word<br/>Tell me the story most precious<br/>Sweetest that ever was heard</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Fasting alone in the desert<br/>Tell of the days that are past<br/>How for our sins He was tempted<br/>Yet was triumphant at last<br/>Tell of the years of His labour<br/>Tell of the sorrow He bore<br/>He was despised and afflicted<br/>Homeless rejected and poor</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Tell of the cross where they nailed Him<br/>Writhing in anguish and pain<br/>Tell of the grave where they laid Him<br/>Tell how He liveth again<br/>Love in that story so tender<br/>Clearer than ever I see<br/>Stay let me weep while you whisper<br/>Love paid the ransom for me</lines>
    </verse>
