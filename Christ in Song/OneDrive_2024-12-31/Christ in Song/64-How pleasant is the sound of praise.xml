    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How pleasant is the sound of praise!
It well becomes the saints of God;
Should we refuse our songs to raise,
The stones might tell our shame abroad.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>For Him Who washed us in His blood,
Let us our sweetest songs prepare;
He sought us wandering far from God,
And now preserves us by His care.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>One string there is of sweetest tone,
Reserved for sinners saved by grace;
’Tis sacred to one class alone
And touched by one peculiar race.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Though angels may with rapture see
How mercy flows in Jesus’ blood,
It is not theirs to prove, as we,
The cleansing virtue of this flood.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Though angels praise the heavenly King,
And worship Him as God alone,
We can with exultation sing,
“He wears our nature on the throne.”</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Lord, we adore Thy wondrous love,
Which brought Thee here to bleed and die
That Thou lost sinners may restore
And to the Father bring them nigh.</lines>
    </verse>
