    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Before Jehovah’s awe-filledful throne,<br/>Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;<br/>Know that the Lord is God alone;<br/>He can create, and He destroy,<br/>He can create, and He destroy.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>His sovereign power, without our aid,<br/>Made us of clay, and formed us men;<br/>And when like wandering sheep we strayed,<br/>He brought us to His fold again,<br/>He brought us to His fold again.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>We are His people, we His care,<br/>Our souls, and all our mortal frame;<br/>What lasting honors shall we rear,<br/>Almighty Maker, to Thy Name,<br/>Almighty Maker, to Thy Name?</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>We’ll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs,<br/>High as the heavens our voices raise;<br/>And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,<br/>Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise,<br/>Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Wide as the world is Thy command,<br/>Vast as eternity Thy love;<br/>Firm as a rock Thy truth must stand,<br/>When rolling years shall cease to move,<br/>When rolling years shall cease to move.</lines>
    </verse>
