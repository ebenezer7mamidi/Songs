    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Of all the gifts Thy love bestows,
  Thou Giver of all good.
E’en heav’n itself no richer knows
  Than Jesus and His blood.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Faith, too, that trusts in Him through grace,
  From that same love we gain;
Else, sweetly as it suits our case,
  The gift had been in vain.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>O Love devine, Thou vast abyss
Our sins buried in thee,
Cover'd is our unrighteousness,
From all debts we are free</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>In Jesus blood our hearts can trace
The footprints of Thy love
And know the riches of Thy grace
The holy righteousness.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>Though heart may fail and flesh decay,
On firm ground we remain,
When earth and heav'n shall pass away,
Our anchor shall sustain.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v6">
      <lines>Until that day, we then shall prove,
The full worth of Thy love.
But here on earth, my life still needs
Thy great sustaining power.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v7">
      <lines>We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,
  To Thee our all we owe:
The precious Savior, and the power
  That makes Him precious too.</lines>
    </verse>
