    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I cannot breathe enough of Thee,
  O gentle breeze of love;
More fragrant than the myrtle tree
The Henna-flower is to me,
  The Balm of Heaven above.
  The Balm of Heaven above.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I cannot gaze enough on Thee,
  Thou Fairest of the Fair;
My heart is filled with ecstasy,
As in Thy face of radiancy
  I see such beauty there.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>I cannot work enough to Thee,
  My Savior, Master, Friend;
I do not wish to go out free,
But ever, always, willingly,
  To serve Thee to the end.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>I cannot sing enough of Thee,
  The sweetest name on earth;
A note so full of melody
Comes from my heart so joyously,
  And fills my soul with mirth.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>I cannot speak enough of Thee,
  I have so much to tell;
Thy heart it beats so tenderly
As Thou dost draw me close to Thee,
  And whisper, “All is well.”</lines>
    </verse>
