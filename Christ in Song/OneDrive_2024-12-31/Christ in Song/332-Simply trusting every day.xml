    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Simply trusting every day;
Trusting through a stormy way;
Even when my faith is small,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Trusting as the moments fly,
Trusting as the days go by,
Trusting Him, whateâ€™er befall,
  Trusting Jesus, that is all.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Brightly doth His Spirit shine
Into this poor heart of mine;
While He leads I cannot fall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Singing if my way be clear,
Praying if the path be drear;
If in danger, for Him call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Trusting Him while life shall last,
Trusting Him till earth is past,
Till His gracious advent call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</lines>
    </verse>
