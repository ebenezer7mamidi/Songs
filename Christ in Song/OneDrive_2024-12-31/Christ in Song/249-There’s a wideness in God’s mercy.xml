    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There’s a wideness in God’s mercy,
Like the wideness of the sea;
There’s a kindness in His justice,
Which is more than liberty.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>There is welcome for the sinner,
And more graces for the good;
There is mercy with the Savior;
There is healing in His blood.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>There is plentiful redemption
In the blood that has been shed;
There is joy for all the members
In the sorrows of the Head.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>For the love of God is broader
Than the measure of our mind;
And the heart of the eternal
Is most wonderfully kind.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v5">
      <lines>If our love were but more simple,
We should take Him at His word;
And our lives would be all sunshine
In the sweetness of our Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
