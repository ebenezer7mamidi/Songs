    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I saw the cleansing fountain
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit’s wooing,
When He said, “Wilt thou be clean?"</lines>
    </verse>  
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I will praise Him! I will praise Him!
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
Give Him glory, all ye people,
For His blood can wash away each stain.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>Though the way seems straight and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v3">
      <lines>Then God’s fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him
Glory, glory to His Name!</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v4">
      <lines>Blessèd be the Name of Jesus!
I’m so glad He took me in;
He’s forgiven my transgressions,
He has cleansed my heart from sin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Glory, glory to the Father!
Glory, glory to the Son!
Glory, glory to the Spirit!
Glory to the Three in One!</lines>
    </verse>
