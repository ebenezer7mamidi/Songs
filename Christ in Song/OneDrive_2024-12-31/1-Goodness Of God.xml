    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I love You, Lord
Oh Your mercy never fails me
All my days, I’ve been held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="C1">
      <lines>Cause all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="v2">
      <lines>I love Your voice, You have led me through the fire
And in darkest night, You are close like no other
I’ve known You as a Father, I’ve known You as a Friend
And I have lived in the goodness of God.</lines>
    </verse>
	<verse name="B1">
      <lines>Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me
With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now
I give You everything
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me.</lines>
    </verse>
<verse name="C2">
      <lines>Cause all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God.</lines>
    </verse>
