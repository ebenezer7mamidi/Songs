Because You have done it.
And I will wait on Your name,
For it is good in the presence
Of Your godly ones.

He will snatch you up
And tear you away from your tent,
And uproot you from the land of the living.

God his refuge, but trusted in the
Abundance of his riches,

Where even angels fear to tread
Invited by redeeming love
Before the throne of God above
He pulls me close with nail-scarred hands
Into His everlasting arms

And Satan tempts me to despair
I hear the voice that scatters fear
The Great I am the Lord is here
Oh praise the One who fights for me
And shields my soul eternally

Blameless now I’m running home
By Your blood I come
Welcomed as Your own
Into the arms of majesty

More beauty than this world has known
I’m face to face with Love Himself
His perfect spotless righteousness
A thousand years, a thousand tongues
Are not enough to sing His praise

Knowing we’re free from condemnation
Oh praise the One, praise the One
Who made an end to all my sin

SongTitle: The Love Of God (Frederick M. Lehman)
VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6
1. The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell,
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell.
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled
And pardoned from his sin.
2. Oh love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure,
The saints’ and angels’ song.
3. When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call.
God’s love, so pure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race,
The saints’ and angels’ song.
4. Oh love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure,
The saints’ and angels’ song.
5. Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made,
Were every stalk on earth a quill
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole
Tho’ stretched from sky to sky.
6. Oh love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure,
The saints’ and angels’ song.

Where Christ is Head and Counselor and Guide;
Where every child is taught His love and favor
And gives his heart to Christ, the crucified;
How sweet to know that tho’ his footsteps waver,
His faithful Lord is walking by his side!

Who always place their hope and trust in Him;
Whose tender patience turmoil never bothers,
Whose calm and courage trouble cannot dim;
A home where each finds joy in serving others,
And love still shines, tho’ days be dark and grim.
3. O give us homes where Christ is Lord and Master,
The bible read, the precious hymns still sung;
Where prayer comes first in peace or in disaster,
And praise is natural speech to every tongue;
Where mountains move before a faith that’s vaster,
And Christ sufficient is for old and young.
4. O Lord, our God, our homes are Thine forever!

Their bonds of love no enemy can sever
If Thou art always Lord and Master there;
Be Thou the center of our least endeavor
Be Thou our guest, our hearts and homes to share.

To leave all behind for the city of God.
Far over the mountain and through the deep hollow,
The path leads us where none before us have trod.
The Master has called us, the children of promise;
We march ‘neath His banner without fear of man.
We love Him and seek Him; we’ve come to be with Him
To rest in His house in His glorious land.

The people to whom God has shown His great light.
With God’s full authority in us residing,
We cannot hold back so we’ve entered the fight.
The Master has called us, though life may be winding,
To turn from our old ways and give Him our all.
Press onward, look upward through much tribulation,
The children of Zion have entered the land.
3. The Master has called us in life’s early morning
With spirits as fresh as the dew on the sod.
We’ve turned from the world with its smiles and its scorning
To cast in our lot with the churches of God.

We count on His blessing and trust in His word.
And through the green pastures, beside the cool waters,
He leads us at last to the city of God.

4. His garments too were in cassia dipped,
With healing in a touch;
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped,
He took me from its clutch.
5. In garments glorious He will come,
To open wide the door;
And I shall enter my heav’nly home,
To dwell forevermore.

SongTitle: Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken (John Newton) (Franz Hayden-music)
VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4
1. Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God;
God, whose word cannot be broken,
Formed thee for His own abode.
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation’s walls surrounded,
thou mayst smile at all thy foes.
2. See, the streams of living waters,
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply Thy sons and daughters,
And all fear of want remove.
Who can faint while such a river
Ever will their thirst assuage?
Grace which like the Lord, the giver,
Never fails from age to age.
3. Round each habitation hovering,
See the cloud and fire appear
For a glory and a covering,
Showing that the Lord is near!
Thus deriving from our banner
Light by night and shade by day,
Safe we feed upon the manna
Which God gives us when we pray.
4. Blest inhabitants of Zion,
Washed in our Redeemer’s blood;
Jesus, whom our souls rely on,
Makes us monarchs, priests to God.
Us, by His great love, He raises,
Rulers over self to reign,
And as priests His solemn praises
We for thankful offering bring.

Upheld by My righteous omnipotent hand.

The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
For I will be with you, your troubles to bless,
And sanctify to you your deepest distress.

My grace, all sufficient, shall be your supply;
The flame shall not hurt you, I only design
Your dross to consume, and your gold to refine.

I will not, I will not forsake to its foes.
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake
I’ll never, no never, no never forsake.

How He gave His life on Calvary to save a wretch like me;
I heard about His groaning, of His precious blood’s atoning,
Then I repented of my sins and won the victory.

He loved me ere I knew Him, and all
my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory beneath
the cleansing flood.

How He made the lame to walk again and caused the blind to see
And then I cried, “Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit.”
And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory.

He sought me and bought me with

And I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing and the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I’ll sing up there the song of victory.

To Thee, now high exalted, our melody we raise.

SongTitle: Since Long Ago at Bethany We Parted (Watchman Nee)
VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7
1. Since long ago at Bethany we parted,
Within my heart there is a ceaseless void;
How can I take my harp down from the willow?
How can my songs without Thee be enjoyed?
And when at night I’m keeping lonely vigil —
Grown numb alike to sorrow and to cheer —
Then I recall the promise of Thy coming,
But sigh: O Lord, why, why Thou dost not yet appear?
2. Thy manger wakes the thought: I too am homeless;
Thy cross strips earthly pleasures from my soul;
Thy coming bids me seek a better country,
For Thou Thyself art now my final goal.
Since Thou art gone my joy has lost its flavor,
My song the sweetness I would fain convey.
Since Thou art gone the sense of void o’erwhelms me.
Oh, how I long that Thou wilt come and not delay.
3. Though even now I know Thy loving presence,
Yet in my heart there’s still a sense of lack.
Enlightening and tenderest sustaining
Can no more satisfy: I want Thee back.
Despite Thy peace within, I still feel lonely;
Despite Thy joy there still remains a sigh;
When I feel most content, the silent yearning
To see Thee face to face becomes an uttered cry.
4. What exile cannot but desire his homeland
And long his people once again to greet?
What soul on alien soil forgets his kindred?
What parted lovers never yearn to meet?
O Lord, how can these earthly loves and pleasures
With all the joy of Thy return compare?
Then, if I cannot here behold Thy countenance,
What can I do but sigh till Thou, my Lord, appear?
5. Could’st Thou, O Lord, forget Thy word of promise
Soon to return and take me unto Thee?
Yet day by day and year by year I’ve waited
And still I wait, and no return I see!
Remember, Lord, the years I have been waiting
While Thy dear footsteps linger far away.
How long? How long? Oh! must I wait still longer
Till Thou shalt come again in glorious array?
6. From generation unto generation
Thy saints have come and gone, but have not seen
Thy glorious promise pass into fulfilment.
How long, how very long the time has been!
Why cannot we, dear Lord, discern Thy footsteps?
Why are the heavens still so closely sealed?
Oh! must our waiting be prolonged still further
Before Thou in Thy matchless splendor art revealed?
7. Lord, I recall the many years I’ve waited
For Thy return — yet, Lord, not I alone,
But Thy dear saints through many generations —
Beseeching Thee to come back for Thine own.
To countless tears and countless fervent pleadings,
By Thine appearing haste to make reply.
Oh, may Thou come, the echo of the ages,
Come, come and answer now this mighty corp’rate cry!

Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the noontide heat,
And the burden of the day.

Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me;
And from my stricken heart with tears
Two wonders I confess:
The wonders of redeeming love
And my unworthiness.

For my abiding place;

The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross.

1. If I could have the world and all it owns.
A thousand kingdoms, a thousand thrones.
If all the earth were mine to hold,
With wealth my only goal,

Without the love that Your life brings
Just a little bit more is all I need,
‘til life was torn from me.

though rich or poor I may be.
Faith can see right through the circumstances,
sees the forest in spite of the trees.

No place to sleep.
No faith in promises You keep.
I’d have no way to bring any bread
With the Bible for my bed.
But if I trust the One who died for me,
Who shed His blood to set me free.
If I live my life to trust in You,
Your grace will see me through.

Yet thought I knew the way
The sin that promised joy and life
Had led me to the grave

A rebel to Your will
And if You had not loved me first

Indifferent to the cost
You looked upon my helpless state
And led me to the cross
And I beheld God’s love displayed
You suffered in my place
You bore the wrath reserved for me
Now all I know is grace

Hallelujah! Jesus is my life [2x]

Could never come from me

When on Thy bosom it has leant and found in Thee

We are on the Lord’s side—Savior, we are Thine!

But with Thine own life blood, for Thy diadem;
With Thy blessing filling each who comes to Thee,

We are on the Lord’s side—Savior, we are Thine!

Strong may be the foe,
But the King’s own army none can overthrow;
’Round His standard ranging, victory is secure,
For His truth unchanging makes the triumph sure.

Would all go away if You’d just say the word
But even if You don’t
My hope is You alone

VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4
1. A mighty fortress is our God.
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great,
And armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.
2. Did we in our own strength confide,
Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God’s own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He;
Lord Sabaoth is His name,
From age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.
3. And though this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed,
His truth to triumph through us.
The prince of darkness grim,
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure, for lo,
His doom is sure: One little word shall fell him.
4. That Word above all earthly powers,
No thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Thro’ Him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;
The body they may kill; God’s truth abideth still:
His kingdom is forever.

I live ‘cause Jesus lives in me
And now I can’t help singin’ of victory

VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3 v4
1. In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This Cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand
2. In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
‘Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live
3. There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin’s curse has lost it’s grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ
4. No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life’s first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
‘Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ,
I’ll stand

Raise the song of harvest home;
All is safely gathered in,
Are the winter storms begin.
God our Maker doth provide
For our wants to be supplied;
Come to God’s own temple, come,
Raise the song of harvest home.
2. All the world is God’s own field,
Fruit as praise to God we yield;
Wheat and tares together sown
Are to joy or sorrow grown;
First the blade and then the ear,
Then the full corn shall appear;
Lord of harvest, grant that we
Wholesome grain and pure may be.
3. For the Lord our God shall come,
And shall take the harvest home;
From the field shall in that day
All offenses purge away,
Giving angels charge at last
In the fire the tares to cast;
But the fruitful ears to store
In the garner evermore.
4. Even so, Lord, quickly come,
Bring Thy final harvest home;
Gather Thou Thy people in,
Free from sorrow, free from sin,
There, forever purified, in Thy presence to abide;
Come, with all Thine angels, come,
Raise the glorious harvest home.

When we taste our gracious Lord.

Ever issued from His store.

Running over, evermore.

Praising for the things He planned
Satisfaction, full and deepening
All our need He doth supply

When we share in all His love.
Unplumbed depths still lie beneath
Unscaled heights rise far above!

All His wondrous tenderness.

He has granted us His sonship, He has seated us above.
When we leave this place so lowly, we’ll be changed into His glory;
We will praise our Jesus only, He is all we need.

Though now this cup, in drinking,
May bitter seem to my faint heart,

And pain and sorrow shall depart,
Swee comfort and sorrow shall fill my heart.

How still we see thee lie;
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep,
The silent stars go by.
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years,
Are met in thee tonight.
2. For Christ is born of Mary and gathered all above,
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O, morning stars together proclaim the holy birth;
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth.
3. How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is giv’n;
So God imparts to human hearts,
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin;
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.
4. O, holy child of Bethlehem,
Descend to us we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in, be born in us today.
We hear the Christmas angels,
The great glad tidings tell’
O, come to us abide with us, our Lord, Emmanuel.

chorus1 : Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified freely forever
One day He’s coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day
1. One day when Heaven was filled with His praises
One day when sin was as black as could be
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
Dwelt among men, my example is He
Word became flesh and the light shined among us
His glory revealed
2. One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain
One day they nailed Him to die on a tree
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected
Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He
Hands that healed nations, stretched out on a tree
And took the nails for me
3. One day the grave could conceal Him no longer
One day the stone rolled away from the door
Then He arose, over death He had conquered
Now He’s ascended, my Lord evermore
Death could not hold Him, the grave could not keep Him
From rising again
4. One day the trumpet will sound for His coming
One day the skies with His glories will shine
Wonderful day, my Beloved One, bringing
My Savior, Jesus, is mine
Glorious day, Oh, Glorious day

Would of Thy love, in all its breadth and length
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
Know more and more.
2. It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine
Lord Jesus, Savior; yet these lips of mine
Would fain proclaim to sinners, far and near
A love which can remove all guilt and fear
And love beget.
3. It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine
Lord Jesus, Savior, yet this heart of mine
Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,
Which brings a rebel sinner, even me,
Nigh unto God.
4. But though I cannot sing, or tell or know
The fullness of Thy love while here below.
My empty vessel I may freely bring
O Thou, who art of love the living Spring,
My vessel fill.
5. Then fill me, O my Savior, with Thy love!
Lead, lead me to the living fount above;
Thither may I, in simple faith, draw nigh,
And never to another fountain fly
But unto Thee.
6. And when, Lord Jesus, Thine own face I see,
When at Thy lofty throne I bow the knee.
Then of Thy love – in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
My soul shall sing.

I rest my weary soul in Thee;

I dare not ask to hide from Thee;
I lay in dust life’s glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be.

Give us Lord each one his part
For creations second birth.

1. Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,
And publish abroad His wonderful name;
the name all-victorious of Jesus extol,
His kingdom is glorious and rules over all.
2. God ruleth on high, almighty to save,
And still He is nigh, His presence we have;
The great congregation His triumph shall sing,
Ascribing salvation to Jesus, our King.
3. “Salvation to God, who sits on the throne!”
Let all cry aloud and honor the Son;
The praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,
Fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.
4. Then let us adore and give Him His right,
All glory and power, all wisdom and might;
All honor and blessing with angels above,
And thanks never ceasing and infinite love.

SongTitle: Rock of Ages (Augustus M. Toplady)
VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3
1. Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.
2. Could my tears forever flow?
Could my zeal no languor know?
These for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone.
In my hand no price I bring;
Simply to Thy cross I cling.
3. While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.

And nothing can I lack.

Which yet I have not seen;
Bright skies will soon be o’er me,
Where darkest clouds have been.

And He will walk with me.

Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

Meet for me Thy grace to prove,
While I sing the countless treasure
Of my God’s unchanging love.

Daily I’m constrained to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.

Seal it for Yourself alone.

Hither by Thy help I’ve come,

Safely to arrive at home.

Wandering from the fold of God.

And vanity shall blind me;

Beneath the standard of the cross
The world hence forth shall find me
I’ve passed in Christ from death to life,
And left the world behind me.
4. My soul shall ne’er return again
Back to its former station,
For here alone is perfect peace
And rest from condemnation;
I’ve made exchange of masters now
The vows of glory bind me,
And once for all I’ve left the world
And left the world behind me.
5. My choice is made forevermore
I want no other savior;
I ask no purer happiness
Than His sweet love and favor;

No more the world shall blind me
I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death,
And left the world behind me.

SongTitle: It Came Upon the Midnight Clear (Edmund H. Sears)
VerseOrder: v1 v2 v3
1. It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old;
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold.
“Peace on the earth good will to men,
From heaven’s all gracious King!”
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.
2. Still thro’ the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled;
And still their heavenly music floats,
O’er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains,
They bend on hovering wing;
And ever o’er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.
3. For lo, the days are hastening on,
By prophet bards foretold;
When with the ever circling years,
Comes round the age of gold.
When peace shall over all the earth,
Its ancient splendors fling;
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing.

With those whose rest is won.
