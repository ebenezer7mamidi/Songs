Son of God, crucified, rose again
And I believe He is reigning in power
The King, Victor over all sin
I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
And the life changing pow’r of His love
And I believe that without Him I’m nothing
Except by the pow’r of His love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It’s the blood of Lord Jesus
That washes me clean
By the blood of Lord Jesus
That I was redeemed
It’s the blood of Lord Jesus
That paid my sins’ price
By the blood of Lord Jesus
I have new life{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}It’s the blood of Lord Jesus

The blood of Lord Jesus
To God reconciled
By the blood of Lord Jesus
He made me His child{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
