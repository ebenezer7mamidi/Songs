On Maryâ€™s lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The babe, the son of Mary.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king, to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
