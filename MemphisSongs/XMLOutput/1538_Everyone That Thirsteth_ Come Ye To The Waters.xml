Come ye to the waters
He that hath no money, come ye and buy
Come and buy and eat,
Yea come without your money
God will give you plenty
And all your need supply.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Why do you spend your money
For things you do not need
And labor for the things which never satisfy?
If your soul is hungry,
The Bread of Life He’ll give you
The Lord will fill your cup and grace He’ll multiply.
Ho!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Come unto the Savior, listen to His voice
Hear Him with your heart and your soul shall live
God the Father promised an everlasting covenant
Righteousness and mercy He will surely give.  Ho!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Seek ye the Lord while He may be found
Call upon His name while the Savior’s near
He will surely answer, abundantly He’ll pardon
He will give you joy and take away your fear.  Ho!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
