An interest in the Savior’s blood?
Died He for me who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued.
Amazing love!  How can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He left His Father’s throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love
And bled for Adam’s helpless race.
‘Tis mercy all, immense and free,
For, Oh my God, it found out me!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Long my imprisoned spirit lay,
Fast bound in sin and nature’s night;
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray;
I woke, my dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose went forth and followed Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus and all in Him is mine!
Alive in Him my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach the eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
