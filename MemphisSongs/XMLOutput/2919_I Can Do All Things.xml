Through my Lord who strengthens me!
I can do all things,
Not by might, nor by strength, but by His
Spirit!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We have but a moment’s time to work for Him;
This life on earth is but a brief encounter.
And the light of this world grows dim
The pressure mounts; sometimes we think we’re gonna’ quit,
And then we put on the faith of our sweet, sweet Lord
Who overcame……He rose again……. and we know….{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}We are running to obtain the Prize
And for the Joy set before us, we will not despise
The race we’re running, it’s the road to Life!
And God will give a yielded heart
The grace to run, the will to come, to believe…..{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
