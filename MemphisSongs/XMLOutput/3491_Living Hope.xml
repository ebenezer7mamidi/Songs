How high the mountain I could not climb
In desperation, I turned to heaven
And spoke your name into the night
Then through the darkness
Your loving kindness
Tore through the shadows of my soul
The work is ﬁnished, the end is written
Jesus Christ, my living hope{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There’s salvation in your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Who could imagine so great a mercy?
What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
The God of ages stepped down from glory
To wear my sin and bear my shame
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
The king of kings calls me His own
Beautiful savior, I’m yours forever
Jesus Christ, my living hope{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There’s salvation in your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Then came the morning that sealed the promise
Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence, the roaring lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Tag:
Jesus, Yours is the victory{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There’s salvation in your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There’s salvation in your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope
Jesus Christ, my living hope
Oh God, you are my living hope{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
