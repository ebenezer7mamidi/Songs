Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled.”
Joyful, all ye nations, rise, join the triumph of the skies;
With angelic hosts proclaim, “Christ is born in Bethlehem.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Christ, by highest heav’n adored, Christ the everlasting Lord;
Late in time behold Him come, offspring of a virgin’s womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see, hail, th’incarnate Deity!
Pleased as man with men to dwell, Jesus our Emmanuel.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Hail the heav’n born Prince of Peace!  Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings, ris’n with healing in His wings,
Mild He lays His glory by, born that man no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
