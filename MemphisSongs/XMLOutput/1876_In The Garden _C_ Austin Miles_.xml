While the dew is still on the roses;
And the voice I hear,
Falling on my ear;
The Son of God discloses.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}And He walks with me,
And He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own,
And the joy we share
as we tarry there,
None other has ever known.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}He speaks, and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,
And the melody that He gave to me,
Within my heart is ringing.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}And He walks with me,
And He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own,
And the joy we share
as we tarry there,
None other has ever known.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I’d stay in the garden with Him
Tho’ the night around me be falling,
But He bids me go;
Thru the voice of woe,
His voice to me is calling.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}And He walks with me,
And He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own,
And the joy we share
as we tarry there,
None other has ever known.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
