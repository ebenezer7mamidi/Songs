Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how he could love me,
A sinner, condemned, unclean.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}How marvelous! How wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! How wonderful
is my Savior’s love for me!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}For me it was in the garden
He prayed: “Not my will, but thine.”
He had no tears for his own griefs,
But sweat-drops of blood for mine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}In pity angels beheld him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them his very own;
He bore the burden to Calvary,
And suffered and died alone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
‘Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of his love for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
