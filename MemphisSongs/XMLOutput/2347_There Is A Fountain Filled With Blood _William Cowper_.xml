Drawn from Immanuel’s veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The dying thief rejoiced to see,
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away;
Wash all my sins away;
Wash all my sins away;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood,
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more;
Be saved, to sin no more;
Be saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}E’er since by faith I saw the stream,
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die;
And shall be till I die;
And shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}When this poor lisping, stammering tongue,
Lies silent in the grave,
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing Thy power to save,
I’ll sing Thy power to save,
I’ll sing Thy power to save,
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing Thy power to save.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
