None or us is worthy, none is right
Take a hold or our wandering hearts
There is no other place to start
What we need, only You can bring
Meet us as we sing{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We’ve come to praise You, We’ve come to praise You
You are God, You are God
You are Holy/Worthy, You are Holy/Worthy
We’ve come to praise You, Praise you{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The bride of Christ is in this house tonight
She’s holy and she’s radiant as Christ
There is no other one like her
She’s the treasure of His heart
What He needs only she can bring
Join her as she sings{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}As we gather in Your name tonight
We assemble Your Son, Jesus Christ
What’s invisible now is seen, it’s no longer a mystery
We are called to know Jesus Christ
As one body{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
