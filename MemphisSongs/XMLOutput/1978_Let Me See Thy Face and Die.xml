I bow,
And prostrate in Thy sight adore;
By faith I see Thee passing now;
I have, but still I ask for more,
A glimpse of love cannot suffice,
My soul for all Thy fullness cries.
I cannot see Thy face and live,
Then let me see Thy face and die!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Moses Thy backward parts might view,
But not a perfect sight obtain;
The gospel doth Thy fullness show
To us, by the commandment slain;
The dead to sin shall find the grace
The pure in heart shall see Thy face.
I cannot see Thy face and live,
Then let me see Thy face and die!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Surrounded by the saints of old,
We now by faith approach to Thee
Shall all with unveiled face behold
In Christ the glorious Deity;
Shall see, and put the Godhead on,
The nature of Thy sinless Son.
I cannot see Thy face and live,
Then let me see Thy face and die!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
