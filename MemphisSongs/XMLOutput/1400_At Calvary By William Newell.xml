Caring not my Lord was crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He died
On Calvary.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Mercy there is great
And grace is free,
Pardon there is multiplied to me,
There my burdened soul finds liberty,
At Calvary.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}By God’s word at last my sin I learned;

Til my guilty soul imploring turned

Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan,
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man.
Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
