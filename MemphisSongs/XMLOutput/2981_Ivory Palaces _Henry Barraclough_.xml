And myrrh their texture fills;
Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine,
With joy my being thrills.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Out of the ivory palaces, into a world of
woe,
Only His great, eternal love made my
Savior go.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}His life had also its sorrows sore,
For aloes had a part;
And when I think of the cross He bore,
My eyes with teardrops start.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}His garments too were in cassia dipped,
With healing in a touch;
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped,
He took me from its clutch.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}In garments glorious He will come,
To open wide the door;
And I shall enter my heavâ€™nly home,
To dwell forevermore.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
