Vanity of vanities, nothing new under the sun
Why spend your money for what is not bread
Why spend your wages for what does not satisfy
Incline your ear, listen to Him{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Have you found your freedom living by the rules
Got a heavy burden and you’re bearing it all by yourself
Come to the waters every one who thirsts
You without money, come
Receive what’s freely given
Delight yourself in Him
chorus2: Can you hear the music and the dancing
The Father’s laid the table and the banquet has begun
Yes He’s gone and killed the fatted calf
For the dead and lost made alive and found again{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Sing about the love of the Father
Sing about His love, the Father’s love
Sing about the love of the Father{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
