Breathe new life into my willing soul.
Bring the presence of the risen Lord
To renew my heart and make me whole
Cause Your Word to come alive in me;
Give me faith for what I cannot see;
Give me passion for Your purity.
Holy Spirit, breathe new life in me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Holy Spirit, come abide within;
May Your joy be seen in all I do─
Love enough to cover ev’ry sin
In each thought and deed and attitude,
Kindness to the greatest and the least,
Gentleness that sows the path of peace.
Turn my striving into works of grace.
Breath of God, show Christ in all I do.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Holy Spirit, from creation’s birth,
Giving life to all that God has made,
Show Your power once again on earth;
Cause Your church to hunger for Your ways.
Let the fragrance of our prayers arise.
Lead us on the road of sacrifice
That in unity the face of Christ
Will be clear for all the world to see.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
