A thousand kingdoms, a thousand thrones.
If all the earth were mine to hold,
With wealth my only goal,
I’d spend my gold on selfish things.
Without the love that Your life brings
Just a little bit more is all I need,
‘til life was torn from me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I’d rather be in the palm of Your hand,
though rich or poor I may be.
Faith can see right through the circumstances,
sees the forest in spite of the trees.
Your graces provides for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}If I should walk the streets,
No place to sleep.
No faith in promises You keep.
I’d have no way to bring any bread
With the Bible for my bed.
But if I trust the One who died for me,
Who shed His blood to set me free.
If I live my life to trust in You,
Your grace will see me through.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
