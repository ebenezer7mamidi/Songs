When we taste our gracious Lord.
Ev’ry cup He fills o’erfloweth
Rich supply He doth afford.
Nothing narrow, nothing stinted
Ever issued from His store.
To His own He gives full measure
Running over, evermore.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}There is always something over
When we, from the Father’s hand
Take our portion with thanksgiving
Praising for the things He planned
Satisfaction, full and deepening
All our need He doth supply
When the heart has tasted Jesus
It’s desires to satisfy.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There is always something over
When we share in all His love.
Unplumbed depths still lie beneath
Unscaled heights rise far above!
Human lips can never utter
All His wondrous tenderness.
We can only praise and wonder
And His name forever bless.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
