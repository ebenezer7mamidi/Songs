We are drinking at the Fountainhead,
And whoso drinks there, Jesus said.
Shall never, never thirst again.
What, never thirst again?
No, never thirst again!
What, never thirst again?
No, never thirst again!
And whoso drinks there, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We are tasting of the living Wine,
In spirit tasting life divine,
And whoso tastes it, every time
Shall have the joy of God.
What, have the joy of God?
Yes, have the joy of God!
What, have the joy of God?
Yes, have the joy of God!
And whoso tastes it, every time
Shall have the joy of God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Christ is the resurrected King
Who died and rose, His life to bring;
If you receive Him, you will sing
And live forevermore.
What, live forevermore?
Yes, live forevermore!
What, live forevermore?
Yes, live forevermore!
If you receive Him you will sing
And live forevermore.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
