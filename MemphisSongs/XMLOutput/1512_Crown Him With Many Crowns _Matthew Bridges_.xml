The Lamb upon His throne.
Hear how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but His own.
Awake my soul, and sing,
Of Jesus’ victory
And hail Him as our matchless King
Through all eternity.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Crown Him the Lord of death;
Behold His hands and side —
Rich wounds that pour forth cleansing blood
To make us glorified.
No angels in the sky
Can fully know that sight,
But downward bend their wondering eyes
At mysteries so bright.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Crown Him the Lord of life;
He lives beyond the grave.
He rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save.
Your glories now we sing;
We praise You for Yourself.
You died eternal life to bring,
To give us endless wealth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Crown Him the Lord of heaven,
One with the Father now.
One with the Spirit through Him given,
Oneness does us allow.
To You be endless worth,
Who made worlds, skies, and seas.
Be now the Lord of heaven and earth
And endless galaxies.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Far, far above our thought
Your counsel does appear,
When in Your time the works complete
That caused our needless fear.
We trust Your sovereign will
To choose and to command.
With wonder filled we stand amazed;
We trust Your faithful hand.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
