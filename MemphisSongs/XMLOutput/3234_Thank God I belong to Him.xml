‘bout my savior and my friend,
Jesus is with me till the very very end
He gives me His love and
His power from above
Thank God I belong to Him{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O the world has appeal-

Thank God I belong to Him{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Well I walked through my life

Thinkin’ about myself

My life was a sham
until I met the Lamb
