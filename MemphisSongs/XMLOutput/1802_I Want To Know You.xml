In the stillness You are there
In the secret, in the quiet hour I wait
only for You
‘Cause I want to know You more.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I want to know You
I want to hear Your voice
I want to know You more

That I might receive the prize
Pressing onward
Pushing every hindrance aside, out of my way
