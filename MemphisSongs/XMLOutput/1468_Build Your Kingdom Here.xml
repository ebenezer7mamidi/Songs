In our hearts again
Increase in us we pray
Unveil why we’re made
Come set our hearts ablaze with hope
Like wildfire in our very souls
Holy Spirit come invade us now
We are Your Church
We need Your Power
In us{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We seek Your Kingdom first
We hunger and we thirst
Refuse to waste our lives
For You’re our joy and prize
To see the captive hearts released
The hurt, the sick, the poor at peace
We lay down our lives for Heaven’s Cause
We are Your Church
We pray Revive
This Earth{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Build Your kingdom here
Let the darkness fear
Show Your mighty hand
Heal our streets and land
Set Your Church on fire
Win this nation back
Change the atmosphere
Build Your kingdom here
We pray{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Unleash Your kingdom’s power
Reaching the near and far
No force of hell can stop
Your Beauty changes hearts
You made us for much more than this
Awake the kingdom seed in us
Fill us with the strength and love of Christ
We are Your Church
We are the hope
On Earth{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
