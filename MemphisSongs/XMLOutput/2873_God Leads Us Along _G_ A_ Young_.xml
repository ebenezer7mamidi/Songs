God leads His dear children along;
Where the water’s cool flow bathes the weary one’s feet.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}God leads His dear children along.
Some thru the waters, some thru the
flood,
some thru the fire, but all thru the blood;
Some thru great sorrow, but God gives a
song,
In the night season, and all the day long.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley, in darkest of night.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Though sorrows befall us and Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Away from the mire and away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity’s day.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
