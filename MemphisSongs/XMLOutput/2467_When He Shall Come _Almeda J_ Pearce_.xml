To take His own from out this vale of night,
O may I know the joy at His appearing
Only at morn to walk with Him in white!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When I shall stand within the court of heaven
Where white-robed pilgrims pass before my sight
Earth’s martyred saints and blood-washed overcomers
These then are they who walk with Him in white!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When He shall call, from earth’s remotest corners,
All who have stood triumphant in His might,
O to be worthy then to stand beside them,
And in that morn to walk with Him in white!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
