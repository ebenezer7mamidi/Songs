Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Joy to the world, the Savior reigns!
Let all their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make his blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
