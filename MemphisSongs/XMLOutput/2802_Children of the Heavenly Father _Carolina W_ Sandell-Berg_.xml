Safely in His bosom gather;
Nestling bird nor star in heaven
Such a refuge e’er was given.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}God His own doth tend and nourish;
In His holy courts they flourish;
From all evil things He spares them;
In His mighty arms He bears them.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Neither life nor death shall ever
From the Lord His children sever;
