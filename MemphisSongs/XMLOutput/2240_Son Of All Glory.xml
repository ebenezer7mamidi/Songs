Put off His mantle drawn by man’s plight.
Entered the battle taking on the form of man
Drawn by His love for us all.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Father of glory released His Son
That He might finish the task begun.
He laid His life down exchanged for our sin.
Drawn by His love for us all.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Who then can separate us from Him
Jesus the Victor death lost it’s sting.
I yield the title to all that I am.
Reborn to live for my King{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Father in heaven grant us to see.
The Day we follow as He followed Thee
Clothed in white raiment cleansed by the Lamb.
Reborn the bride of the King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
