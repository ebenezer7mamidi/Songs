Though friends should all fail us and foes all unite,
Yet one thing secures us, whatever betide,
The promise assures us, “the Lord will provide.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The birds, without garner or storehouse, are fed;
From them let us learn to trust God for our bread.
His saints what is fitting shall ne’er be denied
So long as ‘tis written, “the Lord will provide.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When Satan assails us to stop up our path,
And courage all fails us, we triumph by faith.
He cannot take from us, though oft he has tired,
This heart cheering promise, “the Lord will provide.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}No strength of our own and no goodness we claim;
Yet, since we have known of the Savior’s great name,
In this our strong tower for safety we hide;
The Lord is our power, “the Lord will provide.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
