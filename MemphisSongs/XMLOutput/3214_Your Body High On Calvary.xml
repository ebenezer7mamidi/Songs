Holds Your head for all to see
Behold God’s deepest mystery
The love He gave His all for me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Hearts too weak to come for comfort
Mountains high we cannot climb
Often times we must be carried
Only He our wounds can bind;{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Your body lifts Your head up high
Sinners only need to gaze
Death in You but life in us
If only we can see Your face.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}You bore the pain endured it for us
Willingly gave up Your life
Crown of thorns in stead of glory
Tasting death You paid the price;{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Your body’s side was pierced for us
From it see the streams of life
Blood and water flowing free
Together they prepare Your wife.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
