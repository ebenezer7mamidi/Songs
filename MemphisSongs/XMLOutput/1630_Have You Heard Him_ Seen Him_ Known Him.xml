Is not yours a captured heart?
Chief among ten thousand own Him;
Joyful choose the better part.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Idols once they won me, charmed me
Lovely things that turned my face;
So it was that sin deceived me
‘Til the Lord outpoured His grace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}What has stripped the seeming beauty
From these idols of the earth?
Not a sense of right or duty,
But the sight of peerless worth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}So the crushing of these idols
Was accomplished from the start
By the beaming of His beauty
The unveiling of His heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}It’s the look that melted Peter
It’s the face that Stephen saw
It’s the heart that wept with Mary
Can alone from idols draw.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Draw and win and fill completely
Till the cup o’erflows the brim.
What have we to do with idols
Who have fellowshipped with Him?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
