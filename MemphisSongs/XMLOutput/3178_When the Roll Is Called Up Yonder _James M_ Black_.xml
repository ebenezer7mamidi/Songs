And time shall be no more,
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair.
When the saints on earth shall gather
Over on the other shore,
And the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}On that bright and cloudless morning
When the dead in Christ shall rise,
And the glory of His resurrection share;
When the chosen ones shall gather
To their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Let us labor for the Master from the dawn
‘Til setting sun,
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care;
And when all of life is over
And our work on earth is done,
And the rolll is called up yonder I’ll be there.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
