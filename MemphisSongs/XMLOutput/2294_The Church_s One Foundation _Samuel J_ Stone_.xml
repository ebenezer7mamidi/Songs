Is Jesus Christ her Lord;
She is His new creation, by water and the word.
From heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride,
With His own blood He bought her,
And for her life He died.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Elect from every nation,
Yet one o’er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation,
One Lord, one faith, one birth,
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}‘Mid toil and tribulation, and tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation of peace forevermore;
Till, with the vision glorious,
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the Church at rest.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Yet she on earth hath union with God
The Three in One,
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won.
O happy ones and holy !
Lord, give us grace that we,
Like them, the meek and lowly,
On high may dwell with Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
