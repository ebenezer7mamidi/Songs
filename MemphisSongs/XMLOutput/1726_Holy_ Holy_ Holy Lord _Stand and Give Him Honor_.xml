Worthy, you are worthy, holy Lord.

To receive all worship and praise,
Only You alone are worthy,
Worthy of all honor,
You alone are worthy, holy Lord.
Only You alone are worthy, holy Lord.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Stand and give Him honor, (Lift your voices high.)
Stand and give Him glory, (Come and magnify.)

Stand in adoration, (With the angels cry.)
He alone is worthy, (Come and magnify.)
Jesus Christ who comes to reign over all the world.
Jesus Christ who comes to reign over all the world.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
