All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry everything
to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bare,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful?
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms Heâ€™ll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
