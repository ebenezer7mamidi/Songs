To speak a goodly theme,
To tell what we’ve experienced
Of our exalted King.
Our tongues as pens are ready;
We’ve volumes here to write
The glories of our Bridegroom,
Our Lord and our delight.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord Jesus, You are fairer
Than all the sons of men;
Your goodness is transcendent.
Hallelujah!  Amen!
Upon Your lips most holy,
Abundant grace is poured;
Forever God has blessed you,
Our gracious, glorious Lord!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}You are the Mighty Warrior
Who rides to victory;
Above majestic glory
Ride on triumphantly!
The peoples fall beneath You;
The conquering One You are.
Your arrows in their sharpness
Have entered Satan’s heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Your throne, oh God, forever
And ever shall endure;
The scepter of Your kingdom
Upon the earth is sure;
For with the oil of gladness
God has anointed You
Above all Your companions,
How worthy there to be.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
