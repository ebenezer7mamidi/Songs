And with all who will trust and obey.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Trust and obey, for there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
