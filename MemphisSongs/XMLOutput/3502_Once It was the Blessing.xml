Now it is the Lord;
Once it was the feeling,
Now it is His Word;
Once His gift I wanted,
Now, the Giver own;
Once I sought for healing,
Now Himself alone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}All in all forever,
Only Christ I’ll sing;
Everything is in Christ,
And Christ is everything.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Once ’twas painful trying,
Now ’tis perfect trust;
Once a half salvation,
Now the uttermost;
Once ’twas ceaseless holding,
Now He holds me fast;
Once ’twas constant drifting,
Now my anchor’s cast.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}All in all forever,
Only Christ I’ll sing;
Everything is in Christ,
And Christ is everything.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Once ’twas busy planning,
Now ’tis trustful prayer;
Once ’twas anxious caring,
Now He has the care;
Once ’twas what I wanted,
Now what Jesus says;
Once ’twas constant asking,
Now ’tis ceaseless praise.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}All in all forever,
Only Christ I’ll sing;
Everything is in Christ,
And Christ is everything.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Once it was my working,
His it hence shall be;
Once I tried to use Him,
Now He uses me;
Once the pow’r I wanted,
Now the Mighty One;
Once for self I labored,
Now for Him alone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}All in all forever,
Only Christ I’ll sing;
Everything is in Christ,
And Christ is everything.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v9"><lines>{lang-eng}Once I hoped in Jesus,
Now I know He’s mine;
Once my lamps were dying,
Now they brightly shine;
Once for death I waited,
Now His coming hail;
And my hopes are anchored
Safe within the veil.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
