All my heart to Thee I’ve opened wide.
Now set free from all religious duty,
Only let me in Thyself abide.
As I‘m gazing here upon Thy glory,
Fill my heart with radiancy divine.
Saturate me, Lord, I now implore Thee,
So join now Thy Spirit, Lord, with mine.
(my)           (Thine){/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Shining One – how clear the sky above me!
Son of Man, I see Thee on the throne.
Holy One, the flames of God consume me,
‘Till my being glows with Thee alone.
Lord, when first I saw Thee in Thy splendor,
All self-love and glory sank in shame;
Now my heart its love and praises render,
Tasting all the sweetness of Thy name.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Precious Lord, my flask of alabaster
Gladly now I break in love for Thee.
I anoint Thy head, beloved Master,
Lord, behold, I’ve saved the best for Thee.
Dearest Lord, I waste myself upon Thee,
Loving Thee I’m deeply satisfied.
Love out-poured from hidden depths within me,
Costly oil, dear Lord, I would provide.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}My beloved, come on spices’ mountain;
How I yearn to see Thee face to face.
Drink, dear Lord, from my heart’s flowing fountain,
‘Till I rest fore’er in Thine embrace,
Not alone, O Lord, do I adore Thee,
But with all Thy saints as Thy dear bride,
Quickly come, our love is waiting for Thee;
Jesus, Lord, Thou wilt be satisfied.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
