Has come down to live in us,
And He’s showing grace
And teaching righteousness.
We are seeing Him, my brother;
Won’t you come and see Him too?
Look into the spirit of His holiness.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}And see the sea-walker,
The blind man healer,
The leper-cleansing man of Galilee;
And see the soul-saver,
The One who sets us free,
Take our hand and follow us.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}He has called us with a calling
That was heard but once before,
He has bid us leave the world
And all its charms,
He has freed us from the prison
Of the cares of earthly life,
Now He has us simply rest within His arms{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}And taste the sweet honey
That He has given
He gave His life that we might freely eat
Both His body broken
And precious blood outpoured
Taste and see—the Lord is good.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Now we’re living by His Spirit
As He planned for us to do,
And we’re dwelling in the city
As He planned.
We are tasting of His goodness
Which now flows so rich and free.
We have made our home within this glorious land.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}We’re sharing our abundance
With one another.
It gladdens both the heart of God and man
To see the thanks rendered
With shouts of victory!
Lord, we magnify Your name!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
