He who, began a good work in you
Will be faithful to complete it
He’ll be faithful to complete it

Will be faithful to complete it in You.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}(Sisters)
If the struggle you’re facing is slowly replacing your hope with despair
For the process is long and you’re losing your song in the night.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}(Brothers)
You can be sure that the Lord has His hand on you
Safe and secure He will never abandon you
You are His treasure and He finds His pleasure in you.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
