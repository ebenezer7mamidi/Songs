His jewels were bright rubies of blood
His royal apparel designed with a scourge
Leaving bright crimson stripes on his holy trail{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}And Oh oh oh oh oh he wore it so well
My King's apparel He wore it so well
And Oh oh oh oh oh he wore it so well
My King's apparel He wore it so well{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}His jewelry was nails in His hands and feet
No throne He hung from a sinful tree
