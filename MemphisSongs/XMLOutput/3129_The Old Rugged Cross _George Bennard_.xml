The emblem of suffering and shame.
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best,
For a world of lost sinners was slain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, till my
trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross, and
exchange it some day for a crown.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God, left His glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, till my
trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross, and
exchange it some day for a crown.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,
It’s shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He’ll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I’ll share.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, till my
trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross, and
exchange it some day for a crown.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
