The wine and the bread and the sons of the earth
How beautiful the feet that walked
The long dusty roads and the hill to the cross
How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful
Is the Lord Jesus Christ.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}How beautiful the heart that bled
That took all my sin and bore it instead
How beautiful the tender eyes
That choose to forgive and never despise
How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful
Is the Lord Jesus Christ.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}And as He laid down His life
We offer this sacrifice
That we will live just as He died
Willing to pay the price
Learning to sacrifice{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}How beautiful the radiant bride
Who waits for her groom with His light in her eyes
How beautiful when humble hearts give
The fruit of pure lives so that others may live
How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful
Is the body of Christ{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}How beautiful the feet that bring
The sound of good news and the love of the king
How beautiful the hands that serve
The wine and the bread and the sons of the earth
How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful
Is the body of Christ.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
