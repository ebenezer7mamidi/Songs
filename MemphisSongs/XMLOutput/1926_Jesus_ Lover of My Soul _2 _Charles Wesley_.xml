While the nearer waters roll, while the tempest still is high!
Hide me O my Savior hide, ‘’til the storm of life is past,
Safe into the haven guide. Oh, receive my soul at last!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Other refuge have I none; hangs my helpless soul on Thee.
Leave, ah, leave me not alone; Still support and comfort me!
All my trust on Thee is stayed; all my help from Thee I bring.
Cover my defenseless head, with the shadow of Thy wing.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Thou, O Christ, art all I want; more than all in Thee I find.
Raise the fallen cheer the faint, heal the sick and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name; I am all unrighteousness.
False and full of sin I am; Thou art full of truth and grace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Plenteous grace with Thee is found, grace to cover all my sin.
Let the healing streams abound; make and keep me pure within.
Thou of life the Fountain art, freely let me take of Thee.
Spring Thou up within my heart; rise to all eternity.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
