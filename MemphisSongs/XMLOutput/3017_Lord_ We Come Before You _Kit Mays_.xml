Your dear face we seek
For Your will is pleasant
And Your love is deep.
We would know Your ways, Lord,
Fellowship with You.
Hearts now undivided,
Our souls and spirits true.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord, You know we love You.
Lord, we know You care.
In a world of trouble,
We know You are near.
I would be Your servant.
Treat me as a son.
Leave no part undealt with
Until Your work is done.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Help me Lord, to know You
In the midst of pain,
Sorrow, fear, temptation,
Turn my loss to gain.
I would not resist You.
Pierce straight through my heart.
Till I rest within You
Nevermore to depart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
