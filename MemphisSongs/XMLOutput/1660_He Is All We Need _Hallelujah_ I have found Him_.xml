He has given me His spirit, He has given me a song;
When I wake up in the morning, when I lie down in the evening,
He is standing right beside me, He is all I need.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}(Sisters)         It’s so good to love the brothers,
(Brothers)   It’s so good to love the sisters,
It’s so good to be in Jesus for He
knows our every need.
So we’re sure He’s very near us,
We are sure He always hears us,
We are satisfied in Jesus,
He is all we need.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O Lord Jesus there’s no friend like you for us.

You are all that we are seeing, You are all we need.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Hallelujah He has found us by His patient love,
