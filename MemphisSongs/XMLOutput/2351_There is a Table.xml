Where my Lord is waiting
A Precious table
Where He waits for me
He bids me enter
Into sweet communion
And to remember
His love for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord I remember

Gave to me Your name Lord
You rescued me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}You know my frailties
