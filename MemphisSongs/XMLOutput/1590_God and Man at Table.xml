As now before your very eyes unfold
The wonders all so long ago foretold.
God and man at table are sat down.
God and man at table are sat down.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Elders, martyrs, all are falling down;
Prophets, patriarchs are gath’ring round,
What angels longed to see now man has found.
God and man at table are sat down.
God and man at table are sat down.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Who is this who spreads the vict’ry feast?
Who is this who makes our warring cease?
Jesus, Risen Savior, Prince of Peace.
God and man at table are sat down.
God and man at table are sat down.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Beggars, lame and harlots also here;
Repentant publicans are drawing near,
Wayward sons come home without a fear.
God and man at table are sat down.
God and man at table are sat down.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Worship in the presence of the Lord,
With joyful songs and hearts in one accord,
And let our Host at table be adored.
God and man at table are sat down.
God and man at table are sat down.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}When at last this earth shall pass away,
When Jesus and His bride are one to stay,
The feast of love is just begun that day.
God and man at table are sat down.
God and man at table are sat down.
God and man at table are sat down.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
