Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt.
Yonder on Calvary’s mount outpoured,
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Grace, grace, God’s grace;
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within,
Grace, grace, God’s grace;
Grace that is greater than all our sin.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Sin and despair like the sea waves cold
Threaten the soul with infinite loss.
Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold
Points to the refuge, the mighty cross.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Grace, grace, God’s grace;
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within,

Will you this moment His grace receive?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Grace, grace, God’s grace;
