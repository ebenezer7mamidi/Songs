Creation’s revealing Your majesty.
From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring,
Every creature unique, in the song that it sings.
All exclaiming…{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Indescribable, Uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by
name.
You are amazing God.
All powerful, Untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees and we humbly proclaim,
You are amazing God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go,
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow?
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light,
Yet conceals it to give us the coolness of night?
None can fathom…{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Incomparable, Unchangeable,
You see the depths of my heart and You
Love me the same.
You are amazing God.
You are amazing God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
