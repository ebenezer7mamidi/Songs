I release my pre-conditions
I release myself for what You want to do.
I lay down my cares and burdens
All that’s fearful and uncertain,
I release, I release it to You.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I release my gloom and sadness,
I release my hate and madness,
I release myself for what You want to do
I lay down my pride and passions,
All the pain and life’s infractions,
I release, I release it to You.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Ooh, sing glory, glory hallelujah to You, Jesus,

I release godless tradition
I release myself for what You want to do.
I lay down my life for You, Lord,
All I am and all I live for,
I release, I release it to You.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
