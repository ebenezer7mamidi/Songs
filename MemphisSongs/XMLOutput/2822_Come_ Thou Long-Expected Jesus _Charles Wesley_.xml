Born to set Thy people free;
From our fears and sins release us,
Let us find our rest in Thee.
Israelâ€™s strength and consolation,
Hope of all the earth Thou art;
Dear desire of every nation,
Joy of every longing heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Born Thy people to deliver,
Born a child and yet a King,
Born to reign in us forever,
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.
By Thine own eternal spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone;
By Thine all sufficient merit,
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
