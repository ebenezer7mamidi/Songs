Vast unmeasured, boundless free!
Rolling as a mighty ocean,
In its fullness over me;
Underneath me, all around me,
Is the current of Thy love;
Leading onward, leading homeward
To my glorious rest above.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
Spread His praise from shore to shore!
How He loveth, ever loveth,
Changeth never, never more;
How He watches o’er His loved ones,
Died to call them all His own;
How for them He intercedeth,
Watcheth o’er them from the throne.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
Love of every love the best;
‘Tis an ocean vast of blessing,
‘Tis a haven sweet of rest,
O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
‘Tis a heav’n of heav’ns to me;
And it lifts me up to glory,
For it lifts me up to Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
