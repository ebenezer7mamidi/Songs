A follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Must I be carried to the skies
On flowery beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?
Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
Increase my courage, Lord;
Iâ€™ll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy word.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy saints in all this glorious war
Shall conquer, though they die;
They see the trumph from afar,
By faith they bring it nigh.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}When that illustrious day shall rise,
And all Thy armies shine
In robes of victory through the skies,
The glory shall be Thine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
