No change my heart shall fear;
And safe is such confiding,
For nothing changes here.
The storm may roar without me,
My heart may low belaid,
But God is round about me,
And can I be dismayed?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Wherever He may guide me,
No want shall turn me back;
My Shepherd is beside me,
And nothing can I lack.
His wisdom ever waketh;
His sight is never dim.
He knows the way He taketh,
And I will walk with Him.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Green pastures are before me,
Which yet I have not seen;
Bright skies will soon be o’er me,
Where darkest clouds have been.
My hope I cannot measure;
My path to life is free;
My Savior has my treasure,
And He will walk with me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
