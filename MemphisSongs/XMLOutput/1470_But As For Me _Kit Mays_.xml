O mighty man, mighty man?
The lovingkindness of God endures;
It lasts all day long, all day long.
Your tongue devises destruction
Like a razor sharp you worker of deceit.
You’re a worker of deceit, deceit.
You love evil more than good;
Lies more than that which is right.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}But as for me,
I’m like a green olive tree
In the house of my God,
The house of my God.
I will put my trust in the lovingkindness
Of God forever, and ever and ever.
I will give You thanks  forever
Because You have done it.
And I will wait on Your name,
For it is good in the presence
Of Your godly ones.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}For God will break you down forever
He will snatch you up
And tear you away from your tent,
And uproot you from the land of the living.
And the righteous will see it and fear,
See it and fear.
And they will laugh at you, saying:
“Behold the man who would not make
God his refuge, but trusted in the
Abundance of his riches,
And was strong in his evil desire.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
