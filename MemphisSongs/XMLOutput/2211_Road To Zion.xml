The few that find it never die.
Past mountain peaks graced white with snow;
The way grows brighter as it goes.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}There is a road inside of you
Inside of me there is one, too.
No stumbling pilgrim in the dark
The road to Zion’s in your heart
The road to Zion’s in your heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The river runs beside the road,
It’s waters living as they flow.
In liquid voice the water calls;
On thirsty knees a pilgrim falls.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}There is a road inside of you
Inside of me there is one, too.
No stumbling pilgrim in the dark
The road to Zion’s in your heart
The road to Zion’s in your heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Sometimes a shadow, dark and cold,
Lays like a mist across the road.
But be encouraged by the sight
Where there’s a shadow, there’s a light.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}There is a road inside of you
Inside of me there is one, too.
No stumbling pilgrim in the dark
The road to Zion’s in your heart
The road to Zion’s in your heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Sometimes it’s good to look back down;
We’ve come so far, we’ve gained such ground.
But joy is not in where we’ve been.
Joy is Who’s waiting at the end.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}There is a road inside of you
Inside of me there is one, too.
No stumbling pilgrim in the dark
The road to Zion’s in your heart
The road to Zion’s in your heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
