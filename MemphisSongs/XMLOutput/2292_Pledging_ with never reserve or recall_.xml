Master, shall any who know Thee
Grudge Thee their lives,
Who has laid down Thine own?
Nay! We would offer the hearts that we owe Thee
Live for Thy love and Thy glory alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Sisters, dear sisters, the call us resounding
Will ye not echo the silver refrain
Mighty and sweet, and in gladness abounding?
“Truehearted, whole-hearted!” ringing again{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus is with us, His rest is before us
Brightly His standard in waving above
Sisters, dear sisters, in gathering chorus
Peal out the watchword of courage and love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
