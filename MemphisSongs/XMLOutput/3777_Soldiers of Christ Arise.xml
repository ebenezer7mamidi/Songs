(By Charles Wesley. Tune: “Crown Him with Many Crowns”){/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Soldiers of Christ arise
And put your armor on
Strong in the strength which God supplies
Through His eternal Son
Strong in the Lord of Hosts
And in His mighty power
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
Is more than conqueror{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Stand then in His great might
With all His strength endued
And take to arm you for the fight
The panoply of God
That having all things done
And all your conflicts past
Ye may o’ercome through Christ alone
And stand complete at last{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Leave no unguarded place
No weakness of the soul
Take every virtue every grace
And fortify the whole
To keep your armor bright
Attend with constant care
Still walking in your Captain’s sight
And watching unto prayer{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Pray, without ceasing pray
Your Captain gives the word
His summons cheerfully obey
And call upon the Lord
To God your every want
In instant prayer display
Pray always; pray and never faint
Pray, without ceasing pray{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}From strength to strength go on
Wrestle and fight and pray
Tread all the powers of darkness down
And win the well-fought day
Still let the Spirit cry
In all His soldiers, “Come!”
Till Christ the Lord descend from high
And take the conquerors home{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
