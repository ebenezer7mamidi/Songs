No more clouds in the sky, no more tears to dim the eye;
All is peace for evermore on that happy golden shore.
What a day, glorious day, that will be.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see,
And I look upon His face—the One who saved me by His grace;
When He takes me by the hand,
And He leads me through the Promised Land,
What a day, glorious day, that will be.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There’ll be no sorrow there, no more burdens to bear,
No more sickness, no pain, no more parting over there;
And forever I will be with the One who died for me.
What a day, glorious day, that will be.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
