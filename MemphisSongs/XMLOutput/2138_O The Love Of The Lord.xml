Of the gift of His Son and the hand of a friend. (repeat){/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When you really feel lonely and need a good friend
There’s no one like Jesus He’s there ‘til the end
But His infinite wisdom includes in His plan
A brother or sister to give you a hand{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}You know it’s so easy to slip and to fall
And once you get down you stay under it all
‘Til a friend comes along who’s already been there
And he turns you around by his counsel and prayer{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Sometimes we have problems we can’t understand
We walk in a desert as dry as the sand
We call out to Jesus and ask for some sign
Then the telephone rings and our friend’s on the line.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
