Who will learn how to fly
And I’ve been told that there are those
Who will never die
And I’ve been told that there are stars
That will never lose their shine
And that there is a Morning Star
Who knows my mind.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Why should I worry?  Why should I fret?
‘Cause I’ve got a mansion builder
Who ain’t through with me yet.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I’ve been told that there’s
A crystal lake in the sky
And every tear from my eyes
Is saved when I cry
And I’ve been told there’ll come a time
When the sun will cease to shine
And that there is a morning star
Who knows my mind.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
