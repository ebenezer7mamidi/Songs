Sometimes it feels like I’m breathing But am I alive?
I won’t keep searching for answers That aren’t here to find
All I know is I’m not home yet This is not where I belong
Take this world and give me Jesus This is not where I
belong{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}So when the walls come falling down on me
And when I’m lost in the current of a raging sea
I have this blessed assurance Holding me
All I know is I’m not home yet This is not where I belong
Take this world and give me Jesus This is not where I
belong{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When the earth shakes I wanna be found in You When the
lights fade
I wanna be found in You
All I know is I’m not home yet This is not where I belong
Take this world and give me Jesus This is not where I
belong
Where I belong, where I belong Where I belong, where I
belong{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
