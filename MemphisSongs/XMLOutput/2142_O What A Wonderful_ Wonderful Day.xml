A day I will never forget.
After I’d wandered in darkness away,
Jesus my Savior I met.
O what a tender compassionate friend,
You met the need of my heart.
Shadows dispelling, with joy that is
Swelling,
You made all the darkness depart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, Heaven came down and glory
Filled my soul;
There at the cross my Savior
Made me whole.
My sins were washed away, and
My night is ever day;
Heaven came down and glory
Filled my soul.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Born of the Spirit with life from above,
I have God’s own life divine.
Justified fully thru’ Calvary’s love,
O what a standing is mine.
There the transaction so quickly was made,
When as a sinner I came.
Took of the offer of grace You did offer;
You saved me, O praise Your dear name!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, Heaven came down and glory
Filled my soul;
There at the cross my Savior
Made me whole.
My sins were washed away, and
My night is ever day;
Heaven came down and glory
Filled my soul.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Now I have a hope that will surely endure,
After the passing of time.
I have a future that’s glory for sure,
There in that city divine.
With worldly cares all now taken from me,
When on my Lord I believed,
Cleansing from sin and riches within,
From Your precious hand I received.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, Heaven came down and glory
Filled my soul;
There at the cross my Savior
Made me whole.
My sins were washed away, and
My night is ever day;
Heaven came down and glory
Filled my soul.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
