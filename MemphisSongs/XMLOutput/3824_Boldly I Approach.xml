Blameless now I’m running home
By Your blood I come
Welcomed as Your own
Into the arms of majesty{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="c2"><lines>{lang-eng}This is the art of celebration
Knowing we’re free from condemnation
Oh praise the One, praise the One
Who made an end to all my sin
This is the art of celebration
Knowing we’re free from condemnation
Oh praise the One, praise the One
Who made an end to all my sin{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v1"><lines>{lang-eng}By grace alone somehow I stand
Where even angels fear to tread
Invited by redeeming love
Before the throne of God above
He pulls me close with nail-scarred hands
Into His everlasting arms{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When condemnation grips my heart
And Satan tempts me to despair
I hear the voice that scatters fear
The Great I am the Lord is here
Oh praise the One who fights for me
And shields my soul eternally{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Behold the bright and risen Son
More beauty than this world has known
I’m face to face with Love Himself
His perfect spotless righteousness
A thousand years, a thousand tongues
Are not enough to sing His praise{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
