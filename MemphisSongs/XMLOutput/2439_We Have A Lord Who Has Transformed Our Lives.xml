our lives,
And His name is the Lord Jesus Christ.
He lives in us, being our power
To live for each hour,
Transforming us till we’re like Him.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We called upon His name,
He entered our hearts,
His spirit now dwells in us.

Bread, water and air
And shelter for us.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh Hallelujah, we love You, Lord Jesus;
We get so excited we shout!

We have full liberty;
We’re delirious with joy in our Lord.
Amen!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
