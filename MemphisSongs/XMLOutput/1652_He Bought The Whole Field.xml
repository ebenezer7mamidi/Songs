He bought the whole field for sheer joy.
A man found a treasure,
It was hidden in a field
He bought the whole field for joy.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Paul was a Hebrew by birth.
He left his land to inherit the earth.
He sowed God’s word and when the seed gave yield
In the hearts of a few, he bought the whole field.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}A rich, young man searching for truth.
Who kept the commandments the whole of his youth.
Was promised a Kingdom if he gave away all
But he didn’t have the vision of Paul.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Don’t keep your treasure in a room
For a thief to steal or a moth consume.
All our gain we count but loss
We are rich in Christ who chose a cross.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}The kingdom of Heaven we’ve found
Is so like a treasure hidden in the ground.
The ground is the people who long to be healed
If you really want the treasure love the whole field.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
