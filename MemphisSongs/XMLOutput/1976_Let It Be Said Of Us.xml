That the Lord was our passion;
That with gladness we bore
Every cross we were given;
That we fought the good fight,
That we finished the course;
Knowing within us the pow’r of the risen Lord!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Let the cross be our glory
And the Lord be our song;

Be through us made known.

And the Lord be our song.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Let it be said of us
We were marked by forgiveness;
We were known by our love
And delighted in meekness.

Heeding unity’s call
Joined as one body,
That Christ would be seen by all.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Let the cross be our glory

Be through us made known.
Let the cross be our glory
And the Lord be our song.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
