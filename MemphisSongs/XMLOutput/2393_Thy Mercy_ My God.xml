The joy of my heart and the boast of my tongue
Thy free grace alone from the first to the last
Hath won my affection and bound my soul fast.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Without Thy sweet mercy I could not live here
Sin would reduce me to utter despair
But through Thy free goodness my spirits revived
And He that first made me so keeps me alive.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Thy mercy is more than a match for my heart
Which wonders to feel its own hardness depart
Dissolved by Thy goodness I fall to the ground
And weep to the praise of the mercy Iâ€™ve found.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Great Father of mercies Thy goodness I own
And the covenant love of Thy crucified Son
All praise to the Spirit whose whisper divine
Seals mercy and pardon and righteousness mine!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
