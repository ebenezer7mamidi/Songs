Let us exalt His name together.
I sought the Lord and He heard me,
Delivered me from all my fears.
Oh, taste and see, the Lord is good;
Blessed is the man whose trust is in Him.
Oh, magnify the Lord with me,
Let us exalt His name together.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}My soul does magnify the Lord;
My spirit has rejoiced in God, my Savior.

He that is mighty has done for me
Great things and holy is His name.
My soul does magnify the Lord;
My spirit has rejoiced in God, my Savior.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
