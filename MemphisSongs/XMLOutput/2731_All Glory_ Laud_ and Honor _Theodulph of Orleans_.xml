To whom the lips of children made sweet hosannas Ring.
Thou art the King of Israel, Thou David’s royal Son,
Who in the Lord’s name comest, the King and Blessed One.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The company of angels are praising Thee on high,
And mortal men and all things created make reply.
The people of the Hebrews with psalms before Thee went;
Our praise and prayer and anthems before Thee We present.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}To Thee, before Thy passion, they sang their Hymns of praise;
To Thee, now high exalted, our melody we raise.
Thou didst accept their praises; accept the praise We bring,
Who in all good delightest, Thou good and gracious King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
