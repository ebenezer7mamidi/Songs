Naught of this world’s delusive dream;
I have renounced all sinful pleasure,
Jesus is mine!  There’s nothing between.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
So that His blessed face may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least of His favor;
Keep the way clear!  Let nothing between.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Nothing between, like worldly pleasure;
Habits of life, though harmless they seem,
Must not my heart from Him ever sever,
He is my all!  There’s nothing between.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Nothing between, like pride or station;
Self or friends shall not intervene;
Though it may cost me much tribulation,
I am resolved!  There’s nothing between.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Nothing between, e’en many hard trials,
Though the whole world against me convene;
Watching with prayer and much self-denial,
I’ll triumph at last, with nothing between.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
