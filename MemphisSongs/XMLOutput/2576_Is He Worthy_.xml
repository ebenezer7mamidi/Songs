Do you feel the shadows deepen? We do

Won’t stop the light from getting through? We do
Do you wish that you could see it all made new?
We do{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Is all creation groaning? It is
Is a new creation coming? It is
Is the glory of the Lord
To be the light within our midst? It is
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this?
It is{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Is anyone worthy, is anyone whole?
