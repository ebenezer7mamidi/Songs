A calm and heavenly frame,
A light to shine upon the road
That leads me to the Lamb!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Where is the blessedness I knew,
When first I saw the Lord?
Where is the soul refreshing view
Of Jesus and His Word?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
How sweet their memory still!
But they have left an aching void
The world can never fill.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Return, O holy Dove, return,
Sweet messanger of rest!
I hate the sins that made Thee mourn,
And drove Thee from my breast.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}The dearest idol I have known,
What eâ€™er that idol be,
Help me to tear it from Thy throne,
And worship only Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}So shall my walk be close with God,
Calm and serene my frame;
So purer light shall mark the road
That leads me to the Lamb.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
