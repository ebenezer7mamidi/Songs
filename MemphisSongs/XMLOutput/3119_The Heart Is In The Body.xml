He’s Lord of heaven and earth
His body must be covered
While we ever speak His worth
As we lift our dear Lord Jesus
And this fallen world condemn
Then His body finds fulfillment
When all glory goes to Him.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}His heart is in His body
His body on the earth
Our Head is in the heaven
His Spirit gave us birth
We’re to grow into one new man
Called together in His name
As we lift our dear Lord Jesus
Bear His image, share His shame.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There is a mission given
To the body of our Lord
That we be the full expression
Of His purpose and His worth
Ever led and ever serving
Our Lord Jesus-God’s dear son
Ever holding fast our Savior
And forever with Him one.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
