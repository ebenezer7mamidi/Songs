Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me Lord, some rapturous measure,
Meet for me Thy grace to prove,
While I sing the countless treasure
Of my God’s unchanging love.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O to grace how great a debtor,
Daily I’m constrained to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love.
Here’s my heart, Lord, take and seal it,
Seal it for yourself alone.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Here I raise my Ebenezer,
Hither by Thy help I’ve come,
And I hope by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wandering from the fold of God.
He to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
