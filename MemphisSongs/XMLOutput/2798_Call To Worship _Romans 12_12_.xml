In a land where men are dying,
Holding out the Christ-light in our hands . . . .
And let us lay our lives down, while we can,
While it is still today, before the night
time comes!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Do we lay down what we know;
Or is it just a show . . .
And take up what is real,
When at the cross we kneel?
. . . And the blood flows from one to another,
Love of a Father, through many sons!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Can we forgive our brotherâ€™s fault,
Forget the difference as we ought . . . .
Feel the pain he feels, and then
Share his joy once again?
. . . And the love shows as we love one another,
The world will know the Father has sent His
Son!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
