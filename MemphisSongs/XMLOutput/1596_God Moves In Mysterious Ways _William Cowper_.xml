His wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Deep in unfathomable mines,
Of never-failing skill;
He treasures up His bright designs,
And works His sovereign will.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy,
And shall break in blessings on your head.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him for His grace;
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour.
The bud may have a bitter taste,
But sweet will be the flower.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan His work in vain;
God is His own Interpreter,
And He will make it plain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
