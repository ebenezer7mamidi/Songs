Ye soldiers of the cross!
Lift high His royal banner; it must not suffer loss.
From vict’ry unto vict’ry His army He shall lead,
Til every foe is vanquish’d,
And Christ is Lord indeed.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Stand up, stand up for Jesus!
The trumpet-call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict
In this His glorious day!
Ye that are His, now serve Him
Against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger,
And strength to strength oppose.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Stand up, stand up for Jesus!
Stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you,
Ye dare not trust your own.
Put on the  gospel armor,
Each piece put on with prayer;
Where duty calls or danger,
Be never wanting there.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Stand up, stand up for Jesus!
The strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victor’s song.
To him that overcometh a crown of life shall be;
He with the King of glory shall reign eternally.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
