Sometimes the sky was so far away
Sometimes it seemed to stoop so close
You could touch it but your heart would break
Sometimes the morning came too soon
Sometimes the day could be so hot
There was so much work left to do
But so much You’d already done{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You
Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You
I will seek You in the morning
And I will learn to walk in Your ways
And step by step You’ll lead me
And I will follow You all of my days{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Sometimes I think of Abraham
How one star he saw had been lit for me
He was a stranger in this land
And I am that, no less than he
And on this road to righteousness
Sometimes the climb can be so steep
I may falter in my steps
But never beyond Your reach{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You
Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You
I will seek You in the morning
And I will learn to walk in Your ways
And step by step You’ll lead me
And I will follow You all of my days{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}And I will follow You all of my days
And I will follow You all of my days
And step by step You’ll lead me
And I will follow You all of my days{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}And I will follow You all of my days
[Sometimes the night was beautiful]
And I will follow of my days{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
