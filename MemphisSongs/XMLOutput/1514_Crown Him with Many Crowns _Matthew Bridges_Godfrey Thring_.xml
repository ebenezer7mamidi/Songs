The Lamb upon His throne.
Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own!
Awake, my soul and sing
Of Him who died for Thee;
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Crown Him the Lord of love;
Behold His hands and side,
Rich wounds, yet visible above,
In beauty glorified;
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends His wondering eye
At mysteries so bright.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Crown Him the Lord of life,
Who triumphed oâ€™er the grave.
Who rose victorious to the strife,
For those He came to save.
His glories now we sing,
Who died and rose on high.
Who died eternal life to bring,
And lives that death may die.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Crown Him the Lord of heaven;
One with the Father known,
One with the Spirit through Him given
From yonder glorious throne.
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
Throughout eternity.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
