When sorrows like sea billows roll,
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
“It is well, it is well with my soul.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It is well, (It is well)

Though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control;

When the faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll.

And the Lord shall descend,
Even so — it is well with my soul.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}It is well, (It is well)
