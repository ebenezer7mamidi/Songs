Strength I find to meet my trials here,
Trusting in my Father’s wise bestowment,
I’ve no cause for worry or for fear.
He whose heart is kind beyond all measure,
Give unto each day what He deems best,
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,
Mingling toil with peace and rest.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Eve’ry day the Lord Himself is near me
With a Special mercy for each hour,
All my cares he fain would bear and cheer me,
He whose name is Counselor and Pow’r.
The protection of His child and treasure,
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
“As your days, your strength shall be in measure,
“This the pledge to me He made.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Help me then in ev’ry tribulation,
So to trust Your promises, O Lord;
That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation,
Offered me within Your holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
E’er to take, as from a Father’s hand,
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
‘Til I reach the promised land.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
