I owed a debt I could not pay.
I needed someone to wash my sins away.
And now I sing a brand new song. “Amazing Grace”.
Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}My Father God, He loves me so.
And only He knows what’s within.

And with His help, I’ll get along.
Now I’ve got someone to wash my sins away.
And now I sing a brand new song, “Amazing Grace”.
