Behold how good and how pleasant
It is for the brethren
To dwell together in unity.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It is like precious ointment
Upon the head,
That ran down upon the beard,
Even Aaronâ€™s beard,
And went down to the skirts of his garments.
Bless ye the Lord!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}As the dew of Hermon,
As the dew that descended
Upon the mountains of Zion;
For it was there that the Lord
Commanded His blessing,
Even life forevermore.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
