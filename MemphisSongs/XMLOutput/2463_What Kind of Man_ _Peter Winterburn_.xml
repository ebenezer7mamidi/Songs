I see Your blood, Your sacrifice
And I know You died for me.
What kind of man am I to be?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I read Your word, I long to know
I want to see, help me to grow
In Your ways and holy be
But Lord, the world is tempting me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}My spirit wills, my flesh is weak
Without Your help my life looks bleak.

But it’s so hard to fully give
My life to You and let You in
Lord, take my life and cleanse my sin.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I need Your patience and Your grace
To help me run the lifelong race
And You come through with strength and love
And offer guidance from above.

Both now and evermore.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
