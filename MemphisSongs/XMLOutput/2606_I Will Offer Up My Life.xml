In spirit and truth
Pouring out the oil of love
As my worship to You
In surrender I must give my every part
Lord, receive this sacrifice of a broken heart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
To so faithful a Friend, to so loving a King?
Savior, what can be said, what can be sung
As a praise of Your name, for the things You have done?
Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part
Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}You deserve my every breath, for Youâ€™ve paid the great cost
Giving up Your life to death, even death on the cross
You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin
Open up the gates of heaven and have beckoned me in{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
To so faithful a Friend, to so loving a King?

As a praise of Your name, for the things You have done?
Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part
Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
