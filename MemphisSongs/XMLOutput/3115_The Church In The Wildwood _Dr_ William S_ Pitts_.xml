No lovelier spot in the dale;
No place is so dear to my childhood,
As the little brown church in the vale.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, come, come, come, come
Come to the church by the wildwood,
Oh, come to the church in the vale.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There close by the side of that loved one,
To the trees where the wild flowers bloom;
Where the farewell  hymn will be chanted,
I shall rest by her side in the tomb.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, come, come, come, come

Wing my way to the mansions of light.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, come, come, come, come
