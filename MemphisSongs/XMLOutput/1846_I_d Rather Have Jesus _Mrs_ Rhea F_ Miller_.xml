I’d rather be His than have riches untold;
I’d rather have Jesus than houses or lands;
I’d rather be led by His nail-pierced hands.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Than to be the king of a vast domain.
And be held by man’s old ways.
I’d rather have Jesus than anything
This world affords today.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I’d rather have Jesus than men’s applause;
I’d rather be faithful to His dear cause;
I’d rather have Jesus than world-wide fame;
I’d rather be found calling on His name . . .{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}He’s fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;
He’s sweeter than honey from out of the comb
He’s all I could want and He’s all I need;
I’d rather have Jesus and let Him lead.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
