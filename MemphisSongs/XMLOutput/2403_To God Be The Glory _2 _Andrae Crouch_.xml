For the things You have done for me
Things so undeserved
Yet you give to prove your love for me
The voices of a million angels
Cannot express my gratitude
All that I am or ever hope to be
I owe it all to Thee{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}To God be the glory,
To God be the glory,
To God be the glory for the things He has done.
With His blood He has saved me
With His power He has raised me
To God be the glory
For the things He has done.
Just let me live my life
And let it be pleasing Lord to Thee
And should I gain any praise,
Let it go to Calvary.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}With His blood, He has saved me
By His power, He has raised me
To God be the glory
For the things He has done.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
