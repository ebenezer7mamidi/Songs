When I was lost in sin.
All my life was searching and striving
I had no peace within.
Then Jesus came, spoke my name
And whispered peace to me.
Now I’ve taken my harp down
Off that willow tree.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I’ve taken my harp down off the willow tree.
My heart is singing the victory.
My past is forgiven, my hope is within Him,
All sorrow is gone, the glory has shown
And now I am free.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
