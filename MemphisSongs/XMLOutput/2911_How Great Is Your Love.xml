And no ear has heard
And no man has ever conceived
The glorious things
That You have prepared
For everyone who has believed.
You brought us near
And You called us Your own
And made us joint heirs
With Your Son.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}How high and how wide
How deep and how long
How sweet and how strong is Your love.
How lavish Your grace
How faithful Your ways
How great is Your love, oh Lord.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Objects of mercy
Who should have known wrath
Were filled with unspeakable joy.

And the wonder of knowing Your voice.
You are our treasure
And our great reward
Our hope and our glorious King.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}How high and how wide
