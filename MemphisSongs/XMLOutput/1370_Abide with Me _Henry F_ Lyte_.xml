The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Swift to its close ebbs our life’s little day.
Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away.
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou, who changest not, abide with me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I need Thy presence every passing hour.
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?
Who, like Thyself, my Guide and Stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness,
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine thru’ the gloom and point me to the skies.
Heav’ns morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee.
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
