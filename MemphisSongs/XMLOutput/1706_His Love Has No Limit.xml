He sends more strength when the labors increase.
To added affliction, He adds His mercy,
To multiplied trials, His multiplied peace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}His love has no limit;
His grace has no measure;
His power has no boundary known unto men;
For out of His infinite riches in Jesus,
He gives us, and gives us, and gives us again.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When we have exhausted our store of endurance,
When our strength has failed ere the day is half done,
When we’ve reached the end of our human resources,
Our Father’s full giving has only begun.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
