I am never alone
For Your Spirit is sweet life in me.
As I came from Your side
So the Spirit and bride
Said,”Lord come for Your face we would see.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Come, Lord, quickly come.
Come and dwell in the house
That’s Your home.
For we wait Your return
And with passion we burn
Just for You Lord, dear Lord, quickly come.
