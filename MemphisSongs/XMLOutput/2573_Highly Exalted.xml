You were rejected Lord
Those who passed by
Even averted their gaze from Your sight
Such was the suffering You bore for us
Led like a lamb, a lamb to the slaughter
You spoke not a word, but chose to be silent
Though You did no wrong
Nor was deceitfulness found in You{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Yet by Your wounds our salvation has come
Yet by Your suffering our freedom is won{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}For God has highly exalted Your name
He has enthroned You on high
Jesus the name above all names{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}For God has highly exalted Your name
