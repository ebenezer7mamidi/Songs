There were visions in Your mind
There was death in the fall of mankind
But there was life in salvation’s design
Before there were days
There were nights I could not see Your face
But the night could not keep me from grace
When You came and took my place{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}So I cry holy only begotten Son of God
Ancient of days
I cry holy only begotten Son of God
And sing the praises
Of the One who saved me
And the promises He made{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Before there was time
You counted the hairs on my head
You knew all the words I’ve said
And You purchased me back from the dead
Before I was made
You searched me and knew my ways
You numbered all my days
And You set forth the steps I would take{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}So I cry holy only begotten Son of God
Ancient of days
I cry holy only begotten Son of God
And sing the praises
Of the One who saved me
And the promises He made{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}You saved me; You raised me
You saved me; You pulled me from the grave{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
