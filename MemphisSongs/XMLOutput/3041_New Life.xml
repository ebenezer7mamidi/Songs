On calvary’s tree.
His own blood was shed there
For you and for me.
My old self was nailed there,
So sin could not reign,
With Jesus I died there,
It wasn’t in vain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I have a new life through Jesus Christ,
I’ve risen with Him.
I am a new creature now through Him,
With pow’r over sin.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I’m buried with Jesus,
My old self is dead,
Exchanged for a new life,
With Jesus instead.
When Jesus arose there
From death and the grave,
My sins were forgiven,
And new life He gave.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I have a new life through Jesus Christ,
Complete in God’s son
With pow’r over sin and death and hell,
The victory’s won.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}The life that I now live,
By faith in God’s son,

His will to obey.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Come rule all my life, Lord Jesus Christ
Be master and king.
Come rule all my life, Lord Jesus Christ
You’re my everything.
