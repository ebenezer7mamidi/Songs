The Lamb Who was slain
You ascended to Heaven
And evermore will reign
At the end of the age
When the earth You reclaim
You will gather the nations before You
And the eyes of all men
Will be fixed on the Lamb
Who was crucified
With wisdom and mercy
And justice You’ll reign
At Your Father’s side.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}And the angels will cry
Hail the Lamb
Who was slain for the world
Rule in power
And the earth will reply
You shall reign
As the King of all kings
And the Lord of all lords.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There’s a shield in our hand
And a sword at our side
There’s a fire in our spirits
That cannot be denied
‘Cause the Father has told us
For these You have died
For the nations that gather before You
And the ears of all men need to hear
Of the Lamb
Who was crucified
Who descended to hell
Yet was raised up to reign at
His Father’s side.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}And the angels will cry
Hail the Lamb
Who was slain for the world
Rule in power
And the earth will reply
You shall reign
As the King of all kings
And the Lord of all lords.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
