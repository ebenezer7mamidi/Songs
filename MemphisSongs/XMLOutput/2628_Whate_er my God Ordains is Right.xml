Holy His will abideth;
I will be still whate’er He does;
And follow where He guideth.
He is my God: though dark my road.
He holds me that I shall not fall.
Wherefore to Him I leave it all,
He holds me that I shall not fall.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Whate’er my God ordains is right:
He never will deceive me.
He leads me by the proper path;
I know He will not leave me.
I take, content, what He hath sent.
His hand can turn my griefs away,
And patiently I wait His day,
His hand can turn my griefs away.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Whate’er my God ordains is right,
Though now this cup, in drinking,
May bitter seem to my faint heart,
I take it all, unshrinking.
My God is true; each morn anew.
Sweet comfort yet shall fill my heart,
And pain and sorrow shall depart,
Swee comfort and sorrow shall fill my heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Whate’er my God ordains is right.
Here shall my stand be taken.
Though sorrow, need, or death be mine,
Yet am I not forsaken.
My Father’s care is round me there.
He holds me that I shall not fall,
And so to Him I leave it all,
He holds me that Ishall not fall.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
