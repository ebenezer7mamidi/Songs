Created by human hands
You are not a god
Dependent on any mortal man
You are not a god
In need of anything we can give
By Your plan, that’s just the way it is{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}You are God alone
From before time began
You were on Your throne
Your are God alone
And right now
In the good times and bad
You are on Your throne
You are God alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}You’re the only God
Whose power none can contend
You’re the only God
Whose name and praise will never end
You’re the only God
Who’s worthy of everything we can give
You are God
And that’s just the way it is{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}You are God alone
From before time began

You are God alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Unchangeable Unshakable
Unstoppable that’s what You are{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
