For I have none to give.
I love You, Lord, but all the love is Thine,
For by Your love I live.
I am as nothing, and rejoice to be
Emptied and lost and swallowed up in Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}You, Lord, alone, are all Your children need
And there is none beside;
From You the streams of blessedness proceed,
In You the blessâ€™d abide.
Fountain of Life and all-abounding grace,
Our source, our center, and our dwelling place.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
