Why should the shadows come?
Why should my heart be lonely
and long for heaven and home
When Jesus is my portion?
My constant friend is He;
His eye is on the sparrow,
and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow,
and I know He watches me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When song gives place to sighing,
When hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him;
from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow,
and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow,
and I know He watches me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
