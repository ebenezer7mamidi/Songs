My beauty are, my glorious dress;
Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
With joy shall I lift up my head.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Bold shall I stand in that great Day,
For who aught to my charge shall lay?
Fully through these absolved I am
From sin and fear, from guilt and shame.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The holy, meek, unspotted Lamb,
Who from the Father’s bosom came,
Who died for me, e’en me t’atone,
Now for my Lord and God I own.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord, I believe Thy precious blood,
Which at the mercy-seat of God
Forever doth for sinners plead,
For me–e’en for my soul–was shed.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord, I believe were sinners more
Than sands upon the ocean shore,
Thou hast for all a ransom paid,
For all a full atonement made.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}When from the dust of death I rise
To claim my mansion in the skies,
E’en then, this shall be all my plea:
Jesus hath lived and died for me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus, be endless praise to Thee,
Whose boundless mercy hath for me,
For me, and all Thy hands have made,
An everlasting ransom paid.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
