Sometimes you lose some
And right now, right now I’m losing bad
I’ve stood on this stage night after night
Reminding the broken it’ll be alright
But right now, oh right now I just can’t{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It’s easy to sing
When there’s nothing to bring me down
But what will I say
When I’m held to the flame
Like I am right now{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I know You’re able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don’t
My hope is You alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}They say it only takes a little faith
To move a mountain
Good thing
A little faith is all I have right now
But God, when You choose
To leave mountains unmovable
Give me the strength to be able to sing
It is well with my soul{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I know You’re able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don’t
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You’d just say the word
But even if You don’t
My hope is You alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}You’ve been faithful, You’ve been good
All of my days
Jesus, I will cling to You
Come what may
‘Cause I know You’re able
I know You can{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}I know You’re able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don’t
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You’d just say the word
But even if You don’t
My hope is You alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
