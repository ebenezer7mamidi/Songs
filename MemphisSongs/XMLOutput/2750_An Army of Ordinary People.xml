A kingdom where love is the key,
A city, a light to the nations,
Heirs to the promise are we,
A people whose life is in Jesus,
A nation together we stand,
Only through grace are we worthy,
Inheritors of the land.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}A new day is dawning, a new age to come,
When the children of promise shall flow
together as one.
A truth long neglected, but the time has
now come,
When the children of promise shall flow
together as one.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}A people without recognition,
But with Him a destiny sealed.
Called to a heavenly vision.
His purpose shall be fulfilled,
Come let us stand strong together.
Abandon ourselves to the King.
His love shall be ours forever,
This victory song we shall sing.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}A new day is dawning, a new age to come,
When the children of promise shall flow
together as one.
A truth long neglected, but the time has
now come,
When the children of promise shall flow
together as one.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
