The mountains are the feet of Him
Who brings good news, good news,
Proclaiming peace,
Announcing news of happiness;
Our God reigns, Our God reigns.
Our God reigns, Our God reigns,
Our God reigns, Our God reigns.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}You watchmen lift
Your voices joyfully as one.
Shout for your King,your King.
See with your eyes
The Lord restoring Zion.

Our God reigns, Our God reigns.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Waste places of
