Love’s like a hurricane
I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When all of a sudden
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
And I realize just how beautiful You are
And how great Your affections are for me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}And oh, how He loves us so
Oh how He loves us
How He loves us all

Oh how He loves{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}And we are His portion and
He is our prize
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
If His grace is an ocean, we’re all sinking
And Heaven meets Earth like an unforeseen kiss
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest
I don’t have time to maintain these regrets
When I think about, the way…{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}That He loves us
Oh how He loves us
How He loves us all
Yeah, He loves us
Oh how He loves us
Oh how He loves us
Oh how He loves{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
