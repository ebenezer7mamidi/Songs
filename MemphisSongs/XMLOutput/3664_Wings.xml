I would fly away and be at rest
Away from the tempest
Away from the storm
To my place of refuge so far away{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}You have seen my tears and all my wanderings
I cry to God Most High and You will save me
In the battle against me
You are my peace
You surround me with songs of deliverance
O my soul hope in God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}For You are the rock of my strength
My only hope of salvation is in You
It is in You
Under Your wings I seek refuge
For You sit as king above the flood
In Your shelter I will hide
And find my rest in You{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh to rise with wings like the eagles
To run and walk by faith and not grow weary
This is Your promise for those who wait
God Everlasting will give to them new strength
O my soul hope in God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}For You are the rock of my strength
My only hope of salvation is in You
It is in You
Under Your wings I seek refuge
For You sit as king above the flood
In Your shelter I will hide
And find my rest in You
