When all we know is doubt and fear
There is only one foundation
We believe, we believe
In this generation
When all is dark, You help us see
There is only One Salvation
We believe, We believe{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We believe in God the Father
We believe in Jesus Christ
We believe in the Holy Spirit

We believe in the Crucifixion
We believe that He conquered death
We believe in the resurrection
And He’s comin’ back again
We believe{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}So, let our faith be more than anthems

In the here and now, let love invade!

For the power of God has torn the veil!
Now we know Your love will never fail!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}We believe, we believe!
