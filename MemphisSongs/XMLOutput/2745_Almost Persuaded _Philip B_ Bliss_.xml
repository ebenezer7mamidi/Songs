“Almost persuaded” Christ to receive;
Seems now some soul to say,
“Go, Spirit, go Thy way,
Some more convenient day
On Thee I’ll call.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}“Almost persuaded,” come, come today;
“Almost persuaded,” turn not away;
Jesus invites you here,
Angels are lingering near
Prayers rise from hearts so dear;
O wanderer, come!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}“Almost persuaded,” harvest is past!
“Almost persuaded,” doom comes at last!
“Almost” cannot avail;
“Almost” is but to fail!
Sad, sad, that bitter wail–
“Almost,” but lost!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
