He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor
He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted
And to the captives and prisoners, proclaim their liberty
And to the blind, recovery of sight
And those who are oppressed, to set them free
This is the year of the favor of the Lord
(2nd time, repeat last line){/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Come to Me all who are weary
Come you heavy laden
Come and I will give you rest
Take My yoke upon you
Learn from Me
For I am gentle and humble
And you shall find rest for your souls{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
