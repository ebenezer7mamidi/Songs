But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And now You bid me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come.  I come.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come.  I come.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Just as I am though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings within and fears without,
O Lamb of God, I come.  I come.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Just as I am, poor wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come.  I come.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Just as I am You wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve,
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come.  I come.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Just as I am Your love unknown
Hath broken every barrier down;
Now to be Yours, Yes, Yours alone,
O Lamb of God, I come.  I come.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
