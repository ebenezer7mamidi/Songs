With all its idle pleasures
And set my heart on better things
On higher, holier treasures.
No more its glitter and its glare
And vanity shall blind me;
I’ve crossed the separating line
And left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Far, far behind me.  Far, far behind me
I’ve crossed the separating line
And left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I’ve left the old, sad life of sin
Its follies all forsaken,
My standing place is now in Christ
His holy vows I’ve taken
Beneath the standard of the cross
The world hence forth shall find me
I’ve passed in Christ from death to life,
And left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}My soul shall ne’er return again
Back to its former station,
For here alone is perfect peace
And rest from condemnation;
I’ve made exchange of masters now
The vows of glory bind me,
And once for all I’ve left the world
And left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}My choice is made forevermore
I want no other savior;
I ask no purer happiness
Than His sweet love and favor;
My heart is fixed on Jesus Christ
No more the world shall blind me
I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death,
And left the world behind me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
