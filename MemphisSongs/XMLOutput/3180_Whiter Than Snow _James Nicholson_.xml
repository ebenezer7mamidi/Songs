I want Thee forever to live in my soul,
Break down ev’ry idol, cast out ev’ry foe;
Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,
And help me to make a complete sacrifice;
I give up myself, and whatever I know,
Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait,
Come now, and within me a new heart create;
To those who have sought Thee,
Thou never said’st “No,”
Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Worthy is the Lamb/Thank You for the Cross
Thank You for the cross Lord
Thank You for the price You paid
Bearing all my sin and shame
In love You came and gave amazing grace
Thank You for this love Lord
Thank You for the nail pierced hands
Washed me in the cleansing flow
Now all I know Your forgiveness and embrace{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Worthy is the Lamb
Seated on the throne
Crown You now with many crowns
You reign victorious
High and lifted up
Jesus Son of God
The Treasure of Heaven crucified
Worthy is the Lamb
Worthy is the Lamb{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
