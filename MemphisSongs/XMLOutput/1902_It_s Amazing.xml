Looking for the things
That I thought would fill my heart
And ease my pain.
I can climb the highest mountains,
Or sail beyond the seas,
And it always brings me back to You again, cause{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It’s amazing how You love me.
It’s amazing how You care.

All the time, everywhere.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There are times when I feel lonely
And twisted up inside
On who I am and what I want to be.

And a longing to be free,
And it always brings me back to You again, cause{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}It’s amazing how You love me.

I have lived my life an outlaw on the run,
Leaving broken hearted dreams for everyone.

Another one who’ll know me like You do.
