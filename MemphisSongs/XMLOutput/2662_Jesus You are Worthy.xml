Jesus You are worthy that is what You are
You died alone to save me,
You rose so You could raise me
You did this all to make me a chosen child of God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Worthy is the Lamb that once was slain
To receive all glory power and praise
For with Your blood You purchased us for God

Bearing in Your hurt all that I deserve
Misjudged for my misdeeds You suffered silently
The only guiltless man in all of history{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
