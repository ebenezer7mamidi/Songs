He’s using living stones;
the house of God,
made up of those He calls His own;
a house of peace where He does abide,
and with the Lord we shall all reside
as in love we’re built up into the house of God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Standing before the throne of God are royal priests.
The worship and praises offered there shall never cease.
His bondslaves will forever be all those who dwell in His liberty,
and they’ll reign forever before the throne of God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The Lamb of God is waiting for his wife
His bride; the bride of Christ
who came out from His wounded side.
To Jesus Christ she is looking away,
and with all her heart longing for the day
of the wedding feast  – “Behold the city of God!”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
