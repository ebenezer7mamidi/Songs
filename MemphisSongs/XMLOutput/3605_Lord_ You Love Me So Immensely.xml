I would love You more intensely.
Every day and every moment,
O Lord, capture me.
Let my goal and my lifeâ€™s theme be,
Lord, to love You most supremely;
With all my heart, Lord Jesus,
Keep me faithful unto Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Draw me, Lord, each day.
Take my veils away.
With a pure heart will I see You;
Lord I just love You.
Nothing else I seek;
No one else for me.
I would fully and absolutely
Give my whole being unto Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
