But wars and rumors of wars shall increase.
There is no way for men to end all this fear,
All this pain, all this hate,
All these tears; yet, the answer is here.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When we believer into the Son,
By His Spirit we are made one.
When we believe into the Son,
By His Spirit we are made one.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}(brothers)  We are one.

He our unity has now restored.
Brothers, sisters, in one family —
As the Father and the Son, always one,
So are we!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}How good and pleasant it can be
When brothers dwell in unity;
Like sweet anointing and the mountain dew,
Life eternal for me and you —
All things are new!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
