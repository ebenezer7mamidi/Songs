One day when sin was as black as could be
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
Dwelt among men, my example is He
Word became flesh and the light shined among us
His glory revealed{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified freely forever
One day He’s coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain
One day they nailed Him to die on a tree
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected
Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He
Hands that brought healing, stretched out on a tree
And took the nails for me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified freely forever
One day He’s coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}One day the grave could conceal Him no longer
One day the stone rolled away from the door
Then He arose, over death He had conquered
Now He’s ascended, my Lord evermore
Death could not hold Him, the grave could not keep Him
From rising again{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified freely forever
One day He’s coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day
Oh glorious day{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}One day the trumpet will sound for His coming
One day the skies with His glories will shine
Wonderful day, my Beloved One, bringing
My Savior, Jesus, is mine{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Living, He loved me
Dying, He saved me
Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified freely forever
One day He’s coming
Oh glorious day, oh glorious day
Oh, Glorious day, Oh, Glorious day{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
