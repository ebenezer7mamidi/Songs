In the strength of His might
Stand firm in the Lord
As you walk in the light{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}For your enemy comes
Like a lion he roars
With his lies and temptations,
His threats more and more{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}But He who is with you
Has conquered the beast
There’s a table before you
Look off to the feast{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Be strong and courageous,
Fear not anything
Have faith in your Captain
Now let your soul sing{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I’ll be strong in the Lord

Not to left or to right
I am walking by faith now
And not by my sight
I have fellowship sweet
Thou the enemy stays
For his lies, Christ the truth,
When he tempts, Christ the way.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
