There’s new meaning now to grace.
You took all my sins upon Yourself,
I can only stand amazed.
In the presence of Your infinite might,
I’m so small and frail and weak.
When I see Your pow’r and wisdom, Lord,
I have no words left to speak.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}And I cry holy, holy, holy Lord,
How awesome is Your name.
Holy, holy, holy Lord,
How majestic is Your reign.
And I am changed in the presence of a holy God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}In the presence of a holy God,
All my crowns lie in the dust.
You are righteous in Your judgments, Lord,
You are faithful, true and just.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
