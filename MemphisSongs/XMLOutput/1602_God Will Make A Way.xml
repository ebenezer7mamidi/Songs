Where there seems to be no way,
He works in ways we cannot see,
He will make a way for me;
He will be my guide,
Hold me closely to His side,
With love and strength for each new day,
He will make a way,
He will make a way.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}By a roadway in the wilderness Heâ€™ll lead me,
And rivers in the desert I will see;
Heaven and earth will fade
But His word will still remain,
He will do something new today.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
