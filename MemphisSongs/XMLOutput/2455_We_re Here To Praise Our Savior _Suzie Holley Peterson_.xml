The wonderful Lord of all
We eat, we drink, we live,
We breathe, we dwell in Him.
We magnify Him;
He’s our all in all;
He is our strength;
We cannot fall
Because, because, because,
Because, because —-
Because of the wonderful
Way He loves!  (Brothers-hold,
Sisters-repeat){/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We’re here to sing our praises
To Jesus the King of kings.
To Him we lift our voices high
And call upon His name.
He’s given us life;
He’s made us sons,
He is our head; now we are one.
We’re one, we’re one, we’re one,
We’re one, we’re one —-
Because of the wonderful
Work He’s done.  (Brothers-hold,
Sisters-repeat){/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}We’re here to praise our Savior,
The wonderful Lord of all!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
