You saw to the other side

Praise forever to the King of kings
11. And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
12. And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all whoâ€™d come
To the Father are restored
13. And the Church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
shall not kneel shall not faint
14. By His blood and in His Name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me
15. Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of kings
16. Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of kings
Praise forever to the King of kings{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
