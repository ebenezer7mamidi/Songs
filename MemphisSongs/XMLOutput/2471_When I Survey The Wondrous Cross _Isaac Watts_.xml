On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my Lord.
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to that cross.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down,
Nâ€™er did such love and sorrow meet,
Nor thorns compose so rich a crown.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a tribute far too small.
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
