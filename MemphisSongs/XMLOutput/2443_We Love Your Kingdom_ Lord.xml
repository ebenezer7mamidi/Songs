Is what we long to hear.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We leave all things behind
To answer Your wondrous call.

Come follow the Lord of all! “{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}To hear what You demand
Brings joy, not tears nor pain.

Not as our minds conceive.
