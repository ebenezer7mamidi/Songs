the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes
of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His
terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Glory, glory halleluia! Glory, glory,
hallelulia!
Glory, glory, hallelulia! His truth is
marching on.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I have seen Him in the watchfires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening
dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and
flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Glory, glory halleluia! Glory, glory,

my feet!
Our God is marching on.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Glory, glory halleluia! Glory, glory,

the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you

As He died to make men holy, let us live to make
me free,
While God is marching on.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}Glory, glory halleluia! Glory, glory,
