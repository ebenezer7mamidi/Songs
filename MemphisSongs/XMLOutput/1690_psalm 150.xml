And I simply come
Longing just to bring, something that’s of worth
That will bless Your heart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I’ll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You’re looking into my heart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I’m coming back to the heart of worship
And it’s all about You
It’s all about You, Jesus
I’m sorry, Lord, for the things I’ve made it
When it’s all about You
It’s all about You, Jesus{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}King of endless worth, no one could express
How much You deserve
Though I’m weak and poor, all I have is Yours
Every single breath{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I’ll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required

Through the way things appear
You’re looking into my heart{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}I’m coming back to the heart of worship
And it’s all about You
It’s all about You, Jesus
I’m sorry, Lord, for the things I’ve made it
When it’s all about You
It’s all about You, Jesus{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
