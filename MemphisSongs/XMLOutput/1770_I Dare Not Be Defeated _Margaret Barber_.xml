Come, Lord, and give the vision to nerve me for the fight.
Make me an overcomer clothed with Thy Spirit ‘s might.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}A victor, a victor! Because of Calvary.

A conqu’ er, Lord, in Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I dare not be defeated since Christ, my conquering King
