Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!
What more can He say than to you He has said,
To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Fear not, I am with you, O be not dismayed,
For I am your God, and will still give you aid.
I’ll strengthen you, help you, and cause you to stand,
Upheld by My righteous omnipotent hand.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When through the deep waters I call you to go,
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
For I will be with you, your troubles to bless,
And sanctify to you your deepest distress.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}When through fiery trials your pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient, shall be your supply;
The flame shall not hurt you, I only design
Your dross to consume, and your gold to refine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose
I will not, I will not forsake to its foes.
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake
I’ll never, no never, no never forsake.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
