We joyfully adore You,
Till you appear, your members here
Shall sing like those in glory.
We lift our hearts and voices
With blest anticipation,
And cry aloud, and give to God
The praise of our salvation.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The name we still acknowledge
That burst our bonds asunder,
And loudly sing our conq’ring King,
In songs of joy and wonder.
In every day’s deliverance
Our Jesus we discover;
‘Tis He, “tis He that smote
The sea, and led us safely over.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}While in affliction’s furnace,
And passing through the fire,
Thy love we praise, which knows our days –
And ever bring us nigher.
We clap our hands exulting
In Thine almighty favor:
The love divine which made us
Thine shall keep us Thine forever.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}By faith we see the glory
To which You shall restore us:
The cross despise for that high prize
Which You have set before us.
And if You count us worthy,
We each, as dying Stephen,
Shall see You stand at God’s right hand
To take us up to heaven.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
