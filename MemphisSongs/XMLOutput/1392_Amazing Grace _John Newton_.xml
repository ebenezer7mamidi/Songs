That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Through many dangers, toils and snares,
We have already come.
‘Twas grace that brought us safe thus far,
And grace will lead us home.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be as
Long as life endures.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease.
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine.
But God, Who called me here below,
Will be forever mine.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
