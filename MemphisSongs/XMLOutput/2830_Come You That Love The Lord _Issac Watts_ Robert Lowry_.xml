And let your joys be known.
Sing now a song with sweet accord;
Sing now a song with sweet accord.
Let us surround the throne;
Let us surround the throne.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We’re marching to Zion;
Beautiful, beautiful Zion.
We’re marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}We have refused to sing
Where we were captive held.
We’re coming back to Zion’s hill;
We’re coming back to Zion’s hill
To shout our joys aloud;
To shout our joys aloud.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}See there the city ruins
With all the walls torn down.
We have returned with trowel and sword;
We have returned with trowel and sword.
To be the House of God.
WE ARE THE HOUSE OF GOD!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}The hill of Zion is
A precious building site.
And here a mighty city grows.
And here a mighty city grows.
Made up of living stones.
WE ARE THE LIVING STONES!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Then let our songs abound,
Nor any tongue be still.
We’ve come to claim Immanuel’s ground;
We’ve come to claim Immanuel’s ground.
And here with God we dwell;
AND HERE WITH GOD WE DWELL!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
