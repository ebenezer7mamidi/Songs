When you are discouraged thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings, name them one by one,
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Are you ever burdened with a load of care,
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear,
Count your many blessings ev’ry doubt will fly,
And you will be singing as the days go by.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When you look at others with their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold.
Count your many blessings, money cannot buy,
Help and comfort give you to your journey’s end.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}So amid the conflict whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged God is over all.
Count your many blessings, angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you to your journey’s end.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
