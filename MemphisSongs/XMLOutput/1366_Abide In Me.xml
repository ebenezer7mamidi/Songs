And I in you.
As the branch cannot
Bear fruit of itself
Lest it abides in the vine
So neither can you
Unless you
Abide in Me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I am the Vine
You are the branches
He that abides in Me
And I in him
He bears much fruit
For apart from Me
You can do
Nothing.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Weâ€™ll abide in You
And You in us
We are Your branches, O Lord
And we cannot bear fruit
Unless we abide in You
For You are the vine
And so shall we
Abide in You.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
