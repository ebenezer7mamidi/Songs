Unceasing honor and praise belong,
Worthy is He who sits on the throne.
Suffering grief and then bearing my shame
He gave His all
So I could live.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Now redeemed, costly to Him
This soul was purchased.
How shall I then live on earth?
I yield my whole life —{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}To my Lord
Who’s worthy, deserving of everything
Gladly I offer my all to Him
Oh, for the grace to accomplish this quest
To live for Him.
Worthy is He.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
