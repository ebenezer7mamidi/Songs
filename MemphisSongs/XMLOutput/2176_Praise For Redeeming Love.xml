Let us praise the Savior’s name!
He has hush’d the Law’s loud thunder,
He has quenche’d Mount Sinai’s flame.
He has wash’d us with His blood,
He has brought us nigh to God.
He has wash’d us with His blood,
He has brought us nigh to God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Let us love the Lord who bought us,
Pitied us when enemies;
Call’d us by His grace, and taught us,
Gave us ears, and gave us eyes.
He has wash’d us with His blood,
He presents our souls to God.
He has wash’d us with His blood,
He presents our souls to God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Let us sing tho’ fierce temptations
Threaten hard to bear us down!
For the Lord, our strong salvation,
Holds in view the conqu’rors crown.
He who wash’d us with His blood,
Soon will bring us home to God.
He who wash’d us with His blood,
Soon will bring us home to God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Let us wonder, grace and justice,
Join and point to mercy’s store;
When thro’ grace in Christ our trust is,
Justice smiles, and asks no more:
He who wash’d us with His blood,
Has secur’d our way to God.
He who wash’d us with His blood,
Has secur’d our way to God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Hark! The name of Jesus sounded
Loud, from golden harps above!
Lord, we blush, and are confounded,
Faint our praises, cold our love!
Wash our souls and songs with blood,
For by Thee we come to God.
Wash our souls and songs with blood,
For by Thee we come to God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Let us praise, and join the chorus
Of the saints, enthron’d on high;
Here they trusted Him before us,
Now their praises fill the sky:
“Thou hast wash’d us with Thy blood,
Thou art worthy, Lamb of God!”
“Thou hast wash’d us with Thy blood,
Thou art worthy, Lamb of God!”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
