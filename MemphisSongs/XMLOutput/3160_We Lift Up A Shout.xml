Singing the King’s jubilee.
Anointed to enter the hell gates,
Anointed to set captives free.
We lift up our banner of worship
And Jesus our champion we praise.
An army of worshipers stands by His side,
Baptized in His fire,
Revealing His glorious light.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We lift up a shout!
A victory shout!
For we’ve overcome
by the blood of the Lamb
And the words of our mouth.
We’ve declared war
In the name of the Lord.
We’ve laid down our lives
That the triumph of Christ
May resound in the earth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}We sing the high praises of heaven,
And fight with the sword of the Word.
To bind every stronghold of Satan.
We lift up our standard of worship,
That shatters the darkness with light.
And God will arise on
The wings of our praise,
And march as a warrior who’s mighty
And able to save.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
