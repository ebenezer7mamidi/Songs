Of the darkest day:
Christ on the road to Calvary.
Tried by sinful men,
Torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}This, the pow’r of the cross:
Christ became sin for us;
Took the blame, bore the wrath-
We stand forgiven at the cross.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, to see the pain
Written on Your face,
Bearing the awesome weight of sin.
Ev’ry bitter thought,
Ev’ry evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}This, the pow’r of the cross:
Christ became sin for us;
Took the blame, bore the wrath-
We stand forgiven at the cross.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Now the daylight flees;
Now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head.
Curtain torn in two,
Dead are raised to life;
“Finished!” the vict’ry cry.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}This, the pow’r of the cross:
Son of God-slain for us.
What a love! What a cost!
We stand forgiven at the cross.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, to see my name
Written in the wounds,
For through Your suffering I am free.
Death is crushed to death;
Life is mine to live,
Won through Your selfless love.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}This, the pow’r of the cross:
Son of God-slain for us.
What a love! What a cost!
We stand forgiven at the cross.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
