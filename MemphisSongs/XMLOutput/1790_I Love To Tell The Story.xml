Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love.
I love to tell the story because I know ‘tis true;
It satisfies my longings as nothing else can do.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I love to tell the story
‘Twill be my theme in glory.
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and His love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I love to tell the story, more wonderful it seems
Than all the golden fancies of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the story, it did so much for me;
And that is just the reason I tell it now to Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I love to tell the story; ‘tis pleasant to repeat.
What seems, each time I tell it, more wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story, for some have never heard
The message of salvation from God’s own Holy word.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I love to tell the story, for those who know it best.
Seems hungering and thirsting to hear it, like the rest.
And when in scenes of glory I sing the new, new song,
‘Twill be the old, old story that I have loved so long.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
