To be guided by a hand I cannot hold
To trust in a way that I cannot see
That’s what faith must be{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When the universe fell from His fingertips
He decided He wanted some fellowship
But the man and the woman would not submit
So He made a better way{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When the moment was right He sent His own Son
And He opened the way so that everyone
Could hope and believe that when time was done
He’d be able to make us one{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Now I understand that there is a key
It’s Jesus in me, a reality
That God is in Christ and that Christ’s in me
And with faith I see what is unseen{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
