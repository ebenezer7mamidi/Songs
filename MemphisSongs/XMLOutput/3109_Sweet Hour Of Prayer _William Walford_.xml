That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father’s throne
Make all my wants and wishes known.
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter’s snare
By Thy return, sweet hour of prayer!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
The joys I feel, the bliss I share
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for thy return!
With such I hasten to the place
Where God my Savior shows His face,
And gladly take my station there,
And wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless.
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His word, and trust His grace,
I’ll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for Thee, sweet hour of prayer!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
