Teach me to move in the powâ€™r of Your Spirit
Teach me to walk in the light of Your presence.
Teach me to dance to the beat of Your heart.
Teach me to love with Your heart of compassion.
Teach me to trust in the word of Your promise.
Teach me to hope in the day of Your coming.
Teach me to dance to the beat of Your heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}You wrote the rhythm of life,

In You is joy without measure.
So like a child in Your sight
I dance to see Your delight
For I was made for Your pleasure, pleasure.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Let all my movement express
A heart that loves to say yes
A will that leaps to obey You
Let all my energy blaze
To see the joy in Your face
Let my whole being praise You, praise You.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
