Lord Jesus Savior; yet this soul of mine
Would of Thy love, in all its breadth and length
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
Know more and more.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine
Lord Jesus, Savior; yet these lips of mine
Would fain proclaim to sinners, far and near
A love which can remove all guilt and fear
And love beget.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine
Lord Jesus, Savior, yet this heart of mine
Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,
Which brings a rebel sinner, even me,
Nigh unto God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}But though I cannot sing, or tell or know
The fullness of Thy love while here below.
My empty vessel I may freely bring
O Thou, who art of love the living Spring,
My vessel fill.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Then fill me, O my Savior, with Thy love!
Lead, lead me to the living fount above;
Thither may I, in simple faith, draw nigh,
And never to another fountain fly
But unto Thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}And when, Lord Jesus, Thine own face I see,
When at Thy lofty throne I bow the knee.
Then of Thy love â€“ in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
My soul shall sing.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
