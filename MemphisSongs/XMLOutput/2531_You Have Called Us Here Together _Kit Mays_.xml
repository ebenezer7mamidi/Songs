In the name of Your dear Son
We are gathered unto Jesus
And Your Spirit’s made us one.
Arm and arm we stand together
Side by side we build the wall
As Your body, one new man
All according to Your plan
Christ our head now over all.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Different tribes and different nations
Brought from places near and far
East and west and north and south, Lord
By Your Spirit here we are
Jews and gentiles bound together
We were lost but we’ve been found
Many colors, many tongues
Many songs as yet unsung
But rejoicing has begun.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}We’ve one God who is our Father
We’ve His only begotten Son
We’re one body and one Spirit
And we have one race to run.
We’ve one hope that is our calling
We’ve one Lord, one faith, one birth
We have gone from death to life
Cleanse us Lord to be Your wife
Let Your kingdom come on earth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}As Your body, Lord, now use us
Many members, different gifts
Loving, helping one another
Christ expressed here in our midst
As Your feet and hands and eyes, Lord
Do Your work here on the earth
We’ve Your mind and we’ve Your heart
Give us Lord each one his part
For creations second birth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
