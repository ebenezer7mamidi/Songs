The King of creation!

For He is thy health and salvation!
All ye who hear, now
To His temple draw near;
Join me in glad adoration!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Praise ye the Lord, who oâ€™er all things
So wondrously reigneth,

Yes so gently sustaineth!

How thy longings have been
Granted in what He ordaineth.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Praise ye the Lord, who with
Marvelous wisdom hath made thee!
Decked thee with health, and with loving

How oft in grief hath not
He brought thee relief,
Spreading His wings for to shade thee!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Praise ye the Lord, O let

Come now with praises before Him.
Let the Amen sound from His people again,
Gladly for aye we adore Him.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Praise ye the Lord, Who doth prosper
Thy work and defend thee;
Surely His goodness and mercy
Here daily attend thee.
Ponder anew what the Almightly can do,
If with His love He befriend thee.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
