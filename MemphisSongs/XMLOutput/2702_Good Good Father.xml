Of what they think You’re like
But I’ve heard the tender whispers
Of love in the dead of night
And You tell me that You’re pleased
And that I’m never alone{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}You’re a good good Father
It’s who You are, it’s who You are, it’s who You are
And I’m loved by You

As You call me deeper still
As You call me deeper still
Into love, love, love{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}You’re a good good Father
