Jesus whispers sweet and low,
“Fear not, I am with thee, peace, be still,”
In all of life’s ebb and flow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
Sweetest name I know,
Fills my ev’ry longing,
Keeps me singing as I go.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}All my life was wrecked by sin and strife,
Discord filled my heart with pain,
Jesus swept across the broken strings,
Stirred the slumb’ring chords again.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Feasting on the riches of His grace,
Resting ‘neath His shelt’ring wing,
Always looking on His smiling face,
That is why I shout and sing.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Tho sometimes He leads thro’ waters deep,
Trials fall across the way,
Tho sometimes the path seems rough and steep,
See His footprints all the way.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Soon He’s coming back to welcome me
Far beyound the starry sky;
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown,
I shall reign with Him on high.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
