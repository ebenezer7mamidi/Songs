clothed in holy array.
We worship You, dear Lord, in the beauty of holiness
with an offering of praise.
We only come to You in the raiment You gave us
when on the cross You purchased and saved us.
Removed our rags â€“ cleansed us and robed us in white.
Hidden in You we share the beauty of holiness.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We worship You, dear Lord, in the beauty of holiness
set apart unto Thee.
We worship You, dear Lord, in the beauty of holiness
called to be holy priests.
We bow before Your throne and worship Your Holiness
yielding to Your Rulership over us
Called and ordered by Your Authority
Hidden in You we share the beauty of holiness.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
