O words with heavenly comfort fraught!
What e’er I do, where e’er I be,
Still ‘tis God’s hand that leadeth me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}He leadeth me, He leadeth me, by His own
hand he leadeth me,
His faithful follower I would be, for by His
hand he leadeth me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Sometimes ‘mid scenes of deepest gloom, Sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom,
By waters still o’er troubled sea,
Still ‘tis His hand that leadeth me!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine,
Content whatever lot I see,
Since ‘tis my God that leadeth me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}And when my task on earth is done,
When by Thy grace the vict’rys won,
E’en death’s cold wave I will not flee,
Since God through Jordan leadeth me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
