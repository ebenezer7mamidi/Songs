You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending,
reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights till I’m found,
leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn’t earn it, and I don’t deserve it,
still You give Yourself away,
Oh the overwhelming, never-ending,
reckless love of God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending,
reckless love of God

Oh the overwhelming, never-ending,
reckless love of God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}There’s no shadow You won’t light up
Mountain You won’t climb up
Coming after me
There’s no wall You won’t kick down
Lie You won’t tear down
Coming after me (2x){/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending,

Oh the overwhelming, never-ending,
reckless love of God{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
