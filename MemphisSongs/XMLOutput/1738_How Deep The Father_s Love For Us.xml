How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure
How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Behold the Man upon the cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished.
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I will not boast in anything.
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection
Why should I gain from His reward
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Why should I gain from His reward
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
