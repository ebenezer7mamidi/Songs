Where the saints of God are fed;
He invites His chosen people, “Come and dine”
With His manna He does feed,
And supplies our every need;
Oh, it’s sweet to sup with Jesus all the time!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}“Come and dine,” the Master calls us,
“Come and dine”
We may feast at Jesus’ table all the time!
He who fed the multitude,
Turned the water into wine,
To the hungry calling now, “Come and dine.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The disciples came to land,
Thus obeying Christ’s command;
For the Master called to them,
“Now come and dine.”
There they found their hearts’ desire:
Bread and fish upon the fire;
See, He satisfies the hungry every time!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}“Come and dine,” the Master calls us,

To the hungry calling now, “Come and dine.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Soon the Lamb will take His bride
To be ever at His side;
All the hosts of heaven will assembled be.
It will be a glorious sight,
All the saints in spotless white;
And with Jesus we will feast eternally.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}“Come and dine,” the Master calls us,

You have given us a way
To partake of You throughout the night and day.
So the food we daily eat,
And the water we do drink,
Oh, remind us just how simple is Your way!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}“Come and dine,” the Master calls us,
