Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
Sinking to rise no more;
But the Master of the sea
Heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me,
Now safe am I.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Love lifted me! (even me)
Love lifted me! (even me)
When nothing else could help.
Love lifted me.
Love lifted me! (even me)
Love lifted me! (even me)
When nothing else could help.
Love lifted me.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}All my heart to Him I give,
Even to Him I’ll cling,
In His blessed presence live,
Even His praises sing.
Love so mighty and so true merits
My soul’s best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too,
To Him belongs.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Souls in danger, look above,
Jesus completely saves;
He will lift you by His love
Out of the angry waves.
He’s the Master of the sea,
Billows His will obey;
He, Your Savior wants to be –
Be saved today.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
