“Fear not, I am with thee; peace, be still,” In all of life’s ebb and flow.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, sweetest name I know,
Fills my ev’ry longing, keeps me singing as I go.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}All my life was wrecked by sin and strife; discord filled my life with pain.
Jesus swept across the broken strings, stirred the slumb’ring chords again.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Feasting on the riches of His grace, resting ‘neath His shelt’ring wing,
Always looking on His smiling face, that is why I shout and sing.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Tho’ sometimes He leads thro’ waters deep, trials fall across my way,
Tho’ sometimes the path seems rough and steep, see His footprints all the way.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Soon He’s coming back to welcome me far beyond the starry sky,
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown; I shall reign with Him on high.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
