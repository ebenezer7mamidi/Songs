And to my list’ning ears;
All nature sings and round me rings
The music of the spheres.
This is my Father’s world;
I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
His hand the wonders wrought.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}This is my Father’s world;
The birds their carols raise.
The morning light, the lily white,
Declare their Maker’s praise;
This is my Father’s world;
He shines in all that’s fair,
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass,
He speaks to me every where.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}This is my Father’s world,
O let me ne’er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
God is the Ruler yet.
This is my Father’s world;
The battle is not done;
Jesus, who died, shall be satisfied,
And earth and heav’n be one.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
