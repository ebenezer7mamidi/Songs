You’re fairer than the sons of men
and fresher than the morn.
You’re all that I can say of You and infinitely more,
And every day You’re dearer than You were the day before.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The half cannot be fancied
of such a treasure store,
And every day You’re dearer than You
were the day before.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Your glory broke upon us when we saw You in the night.
You gave us light and sight and promised we would be Your wife.
You fill and satisfy our longing spirits more and more.
And every day You’re dearer than You were the day before.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}The half cannot be fancied
of such a treasure store,
And every day You’re dearer than You
were the day before.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}My life is often dreary
But You come with sweet relief
You take me to the place where only
God and man can meet.
You give me everything
And yet there ‘s always something more
and every day You’re dearer than
You were the day before.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}The half cannot be fancied
of such a treasure store,
And every day You’re dearer than You
were the day before.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
