Since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul, for which long I have sought,
Since Jesus came into my heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Since Jesus came into my heart,
(Since Jesus came in, came into my heart,)
Since Jesus came into my heart,
(Since Jesus came in, came into my heart,)
Floods of joy o’er my soul like the sea
billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I have ceased from my wand’ring and going astray,
Since Jesus came into my heart,
And my sins, which were many, are all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I’m possessed of a hope that is stead fast and sure,
Since Jesus came into my heart,
And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure,
Since Jesus came into my heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}I shall go there to dwell in that City, I know,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And I’m happy, so happy, as onward I go,
Since Jesus came into my heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
