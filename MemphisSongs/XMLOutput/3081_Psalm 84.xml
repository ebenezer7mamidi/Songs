For Your courts, Lord, I supplicate.
Even birds have found a home
Among Your altars, at Your throne.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}There is a road inside of you.
Inside of me there is one, too.
No stumbling pilgrim in the dark
The road to Zion’s in your heart.
The road to Zion’s in your heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Blessed is the man dwelling in Your house;
He’ll still be praising with his mouth.
Blessed is the man who’s strong in You;
To Zion he will make it through.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}He’s shown the way with sun and shield,
His grace and glory’s been revealed.
Not one good thing will He withhold
From those who walk and bear His load.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
