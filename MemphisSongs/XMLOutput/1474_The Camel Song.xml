By an ancient wayside well,
Eliezer paused to rest his camel train.
He had found a bride for Isaac
‘Ere the evening shadows fell
For his weary journey had not been in vain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O get ready!  Evening shadows fall
Don’t you hear the Eliezer call?
There’s going to be a wedding,
And our joy will soon begin,
In the evening when the camel train comes in.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}So he took the fair Rebekah,
Dressed in jewels rich and rare,
Back to Abraham and Isaac far away,
Where Rebekah loved her Isaac,
And he loved Rebekah fair;
Oh, it must have been a happy wedding day.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O get ready!  Evening shadows fall
Don’t you hear the Eliezer call?
There’s going to be a wedding,
And our joy will soon begin,
In the evening when the camel train comes in.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Now the blessed Holy Spirit,
From our Father God above,
Has come down to earth to find a worthy bride.
For our Isaac over yonder
Has prepared his tents of love,
And he wants his fair Rebekah by his side.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}O get ready!  Evening shadows fall
Don’t you hear the Eliezer call?
There’s going to be a wedding,
And our joy will soon begin,
In the evening when the camel train comes in.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v7"><lines>{lang-eng}We have left our kinfolk gladly;
We have bade the world goodbye.
We’ve been called to be His pure and spotless Bride
Where we’ll soon behold our Jesus in that blest eternity
What a happy, happy wedding that will be!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v8"><lines>{lang-eng}O get ready!  Evening shadows fall
Don’t you hear the Eliezer call?
There’s going to be a wedding,
And our joy will soon begin,
In the evening when the camel train comes in.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
