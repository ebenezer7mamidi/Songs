There on the cross He was wounded for me
Gone my transgressions, and now I am free
All because Jesus was wounded for me.
Dying for me, dying for me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}There on the cross He was dying for me
Now in His death my redemption I see
All because Jesus was dying for me.
Risen for me, risen for me
Up from the grave He has risen for me{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Now evermore from death’s sting I am free
All because Jesus has risen for me.
Living for me, living for me
Up in the skies He is living for me;
Daily He’s pleading and praying for me,{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}All because Jesus is living for me.
Coming for me, coming for me
One day to earth He is coming for me;
Then with what joy His dear face I shall see
O how I praise Him – He’s coming for me!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
