In perfect harmony, the man who is God.
Lord of eternity, dwells in humanity;
Kneels in humility and washes our feet.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O what a mystery, meekness and majesty;
Bow down and worship, for this is your God,
This is your God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Father’s pure radiance, perfect in innocence;
Yet learns obedience to death on a cross.
Suff’ring to give us life, conquering through sacrifice;
And as they crucify prays, “Father, forgive.”{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O what a mystery, meekness and majesty;
Bow down and worship, for this is your God,
This is your God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Wisdom unsearchable, God, the invisible;
Love indestructible in frailty appears.
Lord of infinity, stooping so tenderly;
Lifts our humanity to the heights of His throne.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}O what a mystery, meekness and majesty;
Bow down and worship, for this is your God,
