You’re faithful and true to meet all my needs
You lift up my head, give drink when I’m thirsty
From rivers that flow from eternity.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}So I give from what You have given
I give back to You from Your own hand
And I sing of Your bountiful goodness
Your wondrous deeds throughout all the
land.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The work that You start
You’re sure to accomplish
You finish the work
You’ve begun in me
You’ve raised up Your Son
In a world full of darkness
To shine in my heart
So that I can see.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
