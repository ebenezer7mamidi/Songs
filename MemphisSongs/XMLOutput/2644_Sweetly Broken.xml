Of its suffering I do drink
Of its work I do sing
For on it my Savior both bruised and crushed
Showed that God is love
And God is just{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}At the cross You beckon me
You draw me gently to my knees, and I am
Lost for words, so lost in love,
I’m sweetly broken, wholly surrendered{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}What a priceless gift, undeserved life
Have I been given
Through Christ crucified
You’ve called me out of death
You’ve called me into life
And I was under Your wrath
Now through the cross I’m reconciled{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}In awe of the cross I must confess
How wondrous Your redeeming love and
How great is Your faithfulness{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
