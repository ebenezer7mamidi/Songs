To leave all behind for the city of God.
Far over the mountain and through the deep hollow,
The path leads us where none before us have trod.
The Master has called us, the children of promise;
We march ‘neath His banner without fear of man.
We love Him and seek Him; we’ve come to be with Him
To rest in His house in His glorious land.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}The Master has called us to show forth His mystery,
The people to whom God has shown His great light.
With God’s full authority in us residing,
We cannot hold back so we’ve entered the fight.
The Master has called us, though life may be winding,
To turn from our old ways and give Him our all.
Press onward, look upward through much tribulation,
The children of Zion have entered the land.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The Master has called us in life’s early morning
With spirits as fresh as the dew on the sod.
We’ve turned from the world with its smiles and its scorning
To cast in our lot with the churches of God.
The Master has called us, His sons and His daughters;
We count on His blessing and trust in His word.
And through the green pastures, beside the cool waters,
He leads us at last to the city of God.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
