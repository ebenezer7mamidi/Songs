Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;
Leave to thy God to order and provide –
In every change He faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul – thy best, thy heavenly Friend
Thru’ thorny ways leads to a joyful end.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Be still, my soul – thy God doth undertake
To guide the future as He has the past;
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake –
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul – the waves and winds still know
His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Be still, my soul – the hour is hastening on
When we shall be forever with the Lord,
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love’s purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul – when change and tears are past,
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
