All who dwell in dark and sin My hand will save.

Who will bear My light to them?  Whom shall I send?{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Here I am, Lord.  Is it I, Lord?

I will go, Lord, if You lead me.
I will hold Your people in my heart.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I, the Lord of snow and rain, I have borne my peopleâ€™s pain.
