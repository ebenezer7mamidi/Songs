Erkamka Na Adonai
El Elyon Na Adonai
Age to age You’re still the same
By the power of the Name
El Shaddai, El Shaddai
Erkamka Na Adonai{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}We will praise and lift You high,
El Shaddai.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Through Your love and through the ram
You saved the son of Abraham.
Through the power of Your hand
You turned the sea into dry land.
To the outcast on her knees
You were the God who really sees
And by Your might You set your children free.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Through the years You made it clear
That the time of Christ was near.
Though the people couldn’t see
What Messiah ought to be.
Though Your word contained the plan
They just could not understand.
Your most awesome work was done
Through the frailty of Your Son.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
