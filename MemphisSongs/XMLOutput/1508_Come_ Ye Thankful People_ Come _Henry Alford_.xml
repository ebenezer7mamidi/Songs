Raise the song of harvest home;
All is safely gathered in,
Are the winter storms begin.
God our Maker doth provide
For our wants to be supplied;
Come to God’s own temple, come,
Raise the song of harvest home.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}All the world is God’s own field,
Fruit as praise to God we yield;
Wheat and tares together sown
Are to joy or sorrow grown;
First the blade and then the ear,
Then the full corn shall appear;
Lord of harvest, grant that we
Wholesome grain and pure may be.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}For the Lord our God shall come,
And shall take the harvest home;
From the field shall in that day
All offenses purge away,
Giving angels charge at last
In the fire the tares to cast;
But the fruitful ears to store
In the garner evermore.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Even so, Lord, quickly come,
Bring Thy final harvest home;
Gather Thou Thy people in,
Free from sorrow, free from sin,
There, forever purified, in Thy presence to abide;
Come, with all Thine angels, come,
Raise the glorious harvest home.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
