Jehovah is His name;
In pastures fresh He makes me feed,
Beside the living stream.
He brings my wandering spirit back
When I forsake His ways,
And leads me, for His mercyâ€™s sake,
In paths of truth and grace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When I walk through the shades of death
His presence is my stay;
One word of His supporting grace
Drives all my fears away.
His hand, in sight of all my foes,
Doth still my table spread;
My cup with blessings overflows,
His oil anoints my head.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The sure provisions of my God
Attend me all my days;
O may Thy house be my abode,
And all my work be praise.
There would I find a settled rest,
While others go and come;
No more a stranger nor a guest,
But like a child at home.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
