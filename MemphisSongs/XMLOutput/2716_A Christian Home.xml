Where Christ is Head and Counselor and Guide;
Where every child is taught His love and favor
And gives his heart to Christ, the crucified;
How sweet to know that tho’ his footsteps waver,
His faithful Lord is walking by his side!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}O give us homes with Godly fathers, mothers,
Who always place their hope and trust in Him;
Whose tender patience turmoil never bothers,
Whose calm and courage trouble cannot dim;
A home where each finds joy in serving others,
And love still shines, tho’ days be dark and grim.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}O give us homes where Christ is Lord and Master,
The bible read, the precious hymns still sung;
Where prayer comes first in peace or in disaster,
And praise is natural speech to every tongue;
Where mountains move before a faith that’s vaster,
And Christ sufficient is for old and young.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}O Lord, our God, our homes are Thine forever!
We trust to Thee their problems, toil and care;
Their bonds of love no enemy can sever
If Thou art always Lord and Master there;
Be Thou the center of our least endeavor
Be Thou our guest, our hearts and homes to share.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
