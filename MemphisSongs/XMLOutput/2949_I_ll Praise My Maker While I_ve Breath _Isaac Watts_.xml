And when my voice is lost in death,
Praise shall employ my nobler powers;
My days of praise shall ne’er be past,
While life, and thought, and being last,
Or immortality endures.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Happy the man whose hopes rely
On Israel’s God: He made the sky,
And earth, and seas, with all their train;
His truth for ever stands secure,
He saves the oppressed, He feeds the poor,
And none shall find His promise vain.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}The Lord pours eye-sight on the blind;
The Lord supports the fainting mind;
He sends the labouring conscience peace;
He helps the stranger in distress,
The widow, and the fatherless,
And grants the prisoner sweet release.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}I’ll praise Him while He lends me breath,
And when my voice is lost in death,
Praise shall employ my nobler powers;
My days of praise shall ne’er be past,
While life, and thought, and being last,
Or immortality endures.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
