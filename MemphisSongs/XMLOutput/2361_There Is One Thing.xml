There is one thing I desire of Thee;
There is one thing like Mary:
That I may sit at the feet of the Lord
All the days of my life,
All the days of my life,
Just to hear His word and feel His heart,
I want to choose the better part.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}There is one thing, O Lord!
There is one thing I desire of Thee;
There is one thing, like David:
That I may dwell in the house of the Lord
All the days of my life,
All the days of my life,
To behold the beauty of the Lord,
And to inquire in His temple.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}There is one thing, O Lord,
There is one thing I desire of Thee
There is one thing, like Paul,
That I forget what lies behind,
Reaching for what’s ahead
Reaching for what’s ahead,
I will press toward the mark for the prize
Of the high calling of God in Christ.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
