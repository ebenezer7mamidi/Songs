The Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes
Of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His
Terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Glory, glory halleluia!  Glory, glory,
Hallelulia!
Glory, glory, hallelulia! His truth is
Marching on.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}I have seen Him in the watchfires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening
Dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and
Flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never
Call retreat’
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His
Judgment seat;
O be swift, my soul, to answer Him! Be jubilant,
My feet!
Our God is marching on.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across
The sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you
And me,
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make
Men free,
While God is marching on.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
