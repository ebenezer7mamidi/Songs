So here I am but not to stay
There’s a coming King and I give Him my heart
His scarlet cord is clear to see
By His blood I’m clean and free
I testify with His banner free to fly{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}When heaven comes down
And this house of smoke and mirrors fades away
The Promised One Who keeps me will be here to stay
He said to me that He’d be back some day
What a day, when heaven comes down{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}So take a walk around Jericho town
It all looks good ’til the wall comes down
At the trumpet sound of heaven’s coming King
But kingdom come won’t pass away
My faith looks up I’m not dismayed
For my treasure’s there and there my heart’s all set to go{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}When heaven comes down
And this house of smoke and mirrors fades away
The Promised One Who keeps me will be here to stay
He said to me that He’d be back some day
What a day, when heaven comes down{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v5"><lines>{lang-eng}Here we do not have a lasting city
As citizens of heaven we are longing for the day
When our Savior will return in glory
We will finally see Him face to face{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}When heaven comes down
And this house of smoke and mirrors fades away
The Promised One Who keeps me will be here to stay
He said to me that He’d be back some day
What a day, when heaven comes down
Heaven comes down{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
