into Your loveliness,
Then the things that surround become
shadows in the light of You.
When I find the joy of reaching Your heart,
Then my will becomes enthroned in Your love,
And all things that surround become
shadows in the light of You.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}I worship You, I worship You,
The reason I live, is to worship You.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
