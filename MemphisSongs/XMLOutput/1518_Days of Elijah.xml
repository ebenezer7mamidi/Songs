Declaring the Word of the Lord.
And these are the days of Your Servant Moses
Righteousness being restored.
And though these are the days of Great trials
Of famine and darkness and sword,
Still we are the voice in the desert crying
Prepare ye the way of the Lord.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Behold He comes riding on the clouds.
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call
Lift your voice it’s the Year of Jubilee
Out of Zion’s hill salvation comes.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}These are the days of Ezekiel.
The dry bones becoming as flesh.
And these are the days of
Your servant David
Rebuilding a temple of praise.
And these are the days of the harvest
The fields are as white in Your world
And we are the laborers in Your vineyard
Declaring the Word of the Lord.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Behold He comes riding on the clouds.

Shining like the sun at the trumpet call
Lift your voice it’s the Year of Jubilee
Out of Zion’s hill salvation comes.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
