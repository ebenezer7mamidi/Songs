And that you can’t deny;
A God of might and miracles;
‘Tis written in the sky.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}It took a miracle to put the stars in place;

It took a miracle of love and grace.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Though here His glory has been shown,
