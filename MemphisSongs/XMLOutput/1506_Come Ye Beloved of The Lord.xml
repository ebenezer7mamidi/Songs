And consider all the love
That the Father has poured out on you
With joyful hearts in one accord
Come and look upon the love
Of the One who gave His all for you.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Our God withheld not His own Son
The treasure of His heart
Poured out for you
Since He already gave His Son
What now will He withhold
From you His own.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}My friend consider then the price
That so willingly He paid
To redeem and win you back to Him
Consider then how you shall live
And just how to spend the days
And the freedom He has won for you.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Our God withheld not His own Son

Of the earth and of the sky,
And of the universe beyond,
Our Father gave instead His Son,
Counting His worth far beyond
All the treasures of His Kingdom Home.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v6"><lines>{lang-eng}Our God withheld not His own Son
The treasure of His heart
Poured out for you
Since He already gave His Son
What now will He withhold
From you His own.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
