Yet thought I knew the way
The sin that promised joy and life
Had led me to the grave
I had no hope that You would own
A rebel to Your will
And if You had not loved me first
I would refuse You still{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}But as I ran my hell-bound race
Indifferent to the cost
You looked upon my helpless state
And led me to the cross
And I beheld Godâ€™s love displayed
You suffered in my place
You bore the wrath reserved for me
Now all I know is grace{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life [2x]{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone
And live so all might see
The strength to follow Your commands
Could never come from me
O Father, use my ransomed life
In any way You choose
And let my song forever be
My only boast is You{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
