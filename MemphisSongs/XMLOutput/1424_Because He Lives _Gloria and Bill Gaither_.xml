He came to love, heal and forgive.
He lived and died to buy my pardon,
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
Because He lives, all fear is gone.
Because I know He holds the future,
And life is worth the living
Just because He lives!{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}How sweet to hold our newborn baby,
And feel the pride and joy He gives.
But greater still the calm assurance,
This child can face uncertain days
Because He lives.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v4"><lines>{lang-eng}And then one day I’ll cross that river,
I’ll fight life’s final war with pain.
And then as death gives way to vict’ry
I’ll see the lights of glory and I’ll know He reigns.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
