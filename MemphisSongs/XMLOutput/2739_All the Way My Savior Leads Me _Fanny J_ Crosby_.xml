What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy,
Who thro’ life has been my guide?
Heav’nly peace, divinest comfort,
Here by faith in Him to dwell!
For I know, whate’er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v2"><lines>{lang-eng}All the way my Savior leads me,
Cheers each winding path I tread.
Gives me grace for ev’ry trial,
Feeds me with the living bread.
Tho’ my weary steps may falter,
And my soul athirst may be,
Gushing from the Rock before,
Lo! a spring of joy I see.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse><verse name="v3"><lines>{lang-eng}All the way my Savior leads me,
O, the fullness of His love!
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father’s house above.
When my spirit, clothed immortal,
Wings its flight to realms of day.
This my song thro’ endless ages:
Jesus led me all the way.{/lang-eng}</lines></verse></lyrics></song>
