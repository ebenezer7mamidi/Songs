    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord Thy love has sought and found us<br/>Wand'ring in this desert wide<br/>Thou hast thrown Thine arms around us<br/>For us suffered bled and died<br/>Sing my soul He loved thee<br/>Jesus gave Himself for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Hark what sounds of bitter weeping<br/>From yon lonesome garden sweep<br/>'Tis the Lord His vigil keeping<br/>While His followers sink in sleep<br/>Ah my soul He loved thee<br/>Yes He gave Himself for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He is speaking to His Father<br/>Tasting deep that bitter cup<br/>Yet He takes it willing rather<br/>For our sakes to drink it up<br/>Oh what love He loved me<br/>Gave Himself my soul for thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Then that closing scene of anguish<br/>All God's waves and billows roll<br/>Over Him there left to languish<br/>On the cross to save my soul<br/>Matchless love how vast how free<br/>Jesus gave Himself for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Hark again His cries are waking<br/>Eaches on dark Calvary's hill<br/>God my God art Thou forsaking<br/>Him who always did Thy will<br/>Ah my soul it was for Thee<br/>Yes He gave Himself for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Lord we joy Thy toils are ended<br/>Glad Thy suff'ring time is o'er<br/>To Thy Father's throne ascended<br/>There Thou liv'st to die no more<br/>Yes my soul He lives for thee<br/>He who gave Himself for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Lord we worship and adore Thee<br/>For Thy rich Thy matchless grace<br/>Perfect soon in joy before Thee<br/>We shall see Thee face to face<br/>Yet e'en now our song shall be<br/>Jesus gave Himself for me</lines>
