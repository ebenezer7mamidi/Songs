    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>And is it so- I shall be like Thy Son?<br/>Is this the grace which He for me has won?<br/>Father of glory- <br/>thought beyond all thought!-<br/>In glory, to Him own blest likeness brought!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh, Jesus, Lord, who loved me like Thee?<br/>Fruit of Thy work, with Thee, too, there to see<br/>Thy glory, Lord, while endles ages roll,<br/>Myself the prize and travail of Thy soul.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Yet it must be: Thy love had not its rest<br/>Were Thy redeemed not with Thee fully blest;<br/>That love that gives not as the world, but shares<br/>All it possesses with its loved co-heirs.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Nor I alone; Thy loved ones, all complete<br/>In glory, round Thee here with joy shall meet;<br/>All like Thee, for Thy glory like Thee, Lord,<br/>Object supreme of all, by all adored.</lines>
