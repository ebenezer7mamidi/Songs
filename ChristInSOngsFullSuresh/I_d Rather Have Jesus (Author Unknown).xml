    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold<br/>I'd rather be His than have riches untold<br/>I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands<br/>I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause<br/>I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause<br/>I'd rather have Jesus than world wide fame<br/>I'd rather be true to His holy name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He is fairer than the liles of the rarest bloom<br/>He is sweeter than honey from out of the comb<br/>He is all that my hungering spirit needs<br/>I'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Than to be the king of a vast domain<br/>Or be held in sins dread away<br/>I'd rather have Jesus than anything<br/>This world affords today</lines>
