    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Via Bethlehem we journey<br/>We whose hearts on God are set<br/>Babe-like souls of Jesus learning<br/>While our cheeks with tears are wet<br/>For the manger and the stable<br/>Are not pleasant to our eyes<br/>But our feet must follow Jesus<br/>If our hands would grasp the prize</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Via Nazareth the pathway<br/>Narrows still as on we go<br/>Years of toil none understanding<br/>Yet God teaches us to know<br/>That the servant is not greater<br/>Than the lord, who thro' long years<br/>Hid Himself from this world's glory<br/>Follow Him. Count not the tears</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Via Galilee, we see Him<br/>Stones are hurled and curses hissed<br/>By the men who gather round Him<br/>Has He not the pathway missed<br/>No - unharmed the Savior passes<br/>And this rough bit of the way<br/>We must travel since like Jesus<br/>Nothing can our purpose stay</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Via too the awful anguish<br/>Of the hours beneath the trees<br/>Where the hosts of Satan linger<br/>Awful hours of anguish these<br/>Yet we fail not for God's angels<br/>Minister to us and say<br/>"Look, beloved at the glory<br/>Conflict is but for a day!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Then the Cross for via Calvary<br/>Every royal soul must go<br/>Here we draw the veil<br/>For Jesus only can the pathway show<br/>"If we suffer with Him" Listen<br/>Just a little, little while<br/>And the memory will have faded<br/>In the glory of His smile</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Then the grave with dear ones weeping<br/>Knowing that all life has fled<br/>(Fellow-pilgrims art thou numbered<br/>With the men the world calls dead?)<br/>Thence we rise and live with Jesus<br/>Throned above the world's mad strife<br/>Gladly forfeiting forever<br/>All that worldlings count as life</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>On we press and yonder gleaming<br/>Nearing every day we see<br/>The great walls of that fair city<br/>God has built for such as we<br/>And we catch the tender music<br/>Of the choirs that sing of One<br/>Who once died to have us with Him<br/>In His kingdom on the throne</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>Just a few more miles beloved<br/>And our feet shall ache no more<br/>No more sin, and no more sorrow<br/>Hush thee Jesus went before<br/>And I hear Him sweetly whispering<br/>Faint not fear not still press on<br/>For it may be ere tomorrow<br/>The long Journey will be done</lines>
    </verse>
