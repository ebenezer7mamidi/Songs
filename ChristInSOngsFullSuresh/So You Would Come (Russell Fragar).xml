    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Come to the Father<br/>Though your gift is small<br/>Broken hearts broken lives<br/>He will take them all<br/>The power of the Word<br/>The power of His blood<br/>Ev'rything was done<br/>So you would come</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Before the world began<br/>You were on His mind<br/>And ev'ry tear you cry<br/>Is precious in His eyes<br/>Because of His great love<br/>He gave His only Son<br/>Ev'rything was done<br/>So you would come</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Nothing you can do<br/>Could make Him love you more<br/>And nothing that you've done<br/>Could make Him close the door<br/>Because of His great love<br/>He gave His only Son<br/>Ev'rything was done<br/>So you would come</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>The power of the Word<br/>The power of His blood<br/>Everything was done<br/>So you would come</lines>
