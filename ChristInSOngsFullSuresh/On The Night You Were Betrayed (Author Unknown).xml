    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>On the night You were betrayed<br/>You took the bread after giving thanks<br/>You broke it and said<br/>"This is My body, broken for you<br/>And as you eat it, remember Me"<br/>"This is My body, broken for you<br/>And as you eat it, remember Me"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>On the night You were betrayed<br/>You held the cup after giving thanks<br/>You lifted it up<br/>"This is my blood, poured out for you<br/>And as you drink it, remember Me"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>So we thank You for the wine and for the bread<br/>For we see the life You gave<br/>And the blood you shed<br/>And we remember Your wondrous love<br/>You gave your body - You shed your blood<br/>And we remember Your wondrous love<br/>You gave your body - You shed your blood</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Yes, we remember Your wondrous love<br/>You gave your body - you shed your blood<br/>Yes, we remember Your wondrous love<br/>You gave your body - you shed your blood</lines>
