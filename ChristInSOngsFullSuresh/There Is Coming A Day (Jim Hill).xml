    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>What a day that will be<br/>When my Jesus I shall see<br/>When I look upon His face<br/>The One who saved me by His grace<br/>When He takes me by the hand<br/>And leads me through the Promised Land<br/>What a day glorious day that will be</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is coming a day<br/>When no heartaches shall come<br/>No more clouds in the sky<br/>No more tears to dim the eye<br/>All is peace forevermore<br/>On that happy golden shore<br/>What a day glorious day that will be</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There'll be no sorrow there<br/>No more burdens to bear<br/>No more sickness no pain<br/>No more parting over there<br/>And forever I will be<br/>With the One who died for me<br/>What a day glorious day that will be</lines>
    </verse>
