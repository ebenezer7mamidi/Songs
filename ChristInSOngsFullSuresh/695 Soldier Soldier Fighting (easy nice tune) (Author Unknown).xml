    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Soldier soldier fighting<br/>In the world's great strife<br/>On thyself relying<br/>Battling for thy life<br/>Trust thyself no longer<br/>Trust to Christ - He's stronger<br/>I can all things - all things do<br/>Through Christ who strengthens me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In your daily duty<br/>Standing up for right<br/>Are you sometimes weary heart<br/>Not always light<br/>Doubt your Savior never<br/>This your secret ever<br/>I can all things - all things do<br/>Through Christ who strengthens me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>If your way be weary<br/>He will help you through<br/>Help you in your troubles<br/>And your pleasures too<br/>Say when Satan's by you<br/>Say when all things try you<br/>I can all things - all things do<br/>Through Christ who strengthens me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>In a world of trouble<br/>Tempted oft to stray<br/>You need never stumble<br/>Satan cannot stay<br/>Will but tempt you vainly<br/>If you tell him plainly<br/>I can all things - all things do<br/>Through Christ who strengthens me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Jesus' power is boundless<br/>Boundless as the sea<br/>He is always able - able to keep me<br/>Power bring from my weakness<br/>Glory from my meekness<br/>I can all things - all things do<br/>Through Christ who strengthens me</lines>
    </verse>
