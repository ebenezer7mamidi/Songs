      <lines>I have seen Him I have known Him<br/>For He deigns to walk with me<br/>And the glory of His presence will be mine eternally<br/>O the glory of His presence<br/>O the beauty of His face<br/>I am His and His forever<br/>He has won me by His grace</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In my failure - sin and sorrow<br/>Broken hearted<br/>Crushed and torn<br/>I have felt His presence<br/>Near me<br/>He has all my burdens borne</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>In the darkness in the shadow<br/>With the Savior I have trod<br/>Sweet indeed have been the lessons<br/>Since I've walked<br/>Alone with God</lines>
