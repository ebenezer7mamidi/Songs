    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I then shall live as one who's been forgiven<br/>I'll walk with joy to know my debts are paid<br/>I know my name is clear before my Father<br/>I am His child and I am not afraid<br/>So greatly pardoned I'll forgive my brother<br/>The law of love I gladly will obey</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I then shall live as one who's learned compassion<br/>I've been so loved that I'll risk loving too<br/>I'll know how fear builds walls instead of bridges<br/>I'll dare to see another's point of view<br/>And when relationships demand commitment<br/>Then I'll be there to care and follow through</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Your Kingdom come around and through and in me<br/>Your pow'r and glory let them shine through me<br/>Your hallowed name oh may I bear with honor<br/>And may Your living Kingdom come in me<br/>The Bread of Life oh may I share with honor<br/>And may You feed a hungry world through me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>And may You feed a hungry world through me<br/>Amen</lines>
    </verse>
