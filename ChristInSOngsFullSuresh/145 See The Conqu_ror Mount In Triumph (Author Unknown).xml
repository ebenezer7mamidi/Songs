    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>See the Conqu'ror mount in triumph<br/>See the King in royal state<br/>Riding on the clouds His chariot<br/>To His heav'nly palace gate<br/>Hark The choirs of angel voices<br/>Joyful hallelujahs sing<br/>And the portals high are lifted<br/>To receive - To receive - To receive<br/>Their heav'nly King</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who is this that comes in glory<br/>With the trump of jubilee<br/>Lord of battle God of armies<br/>He has gained the victory<br/>He who on the cross did suffer<br/>He who from the grave arose<br/>He has vanquised sin and Satan<br/>He by death - He by death - He by death<br/>Has spoiled His foes</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>While He lifts His hands in blessing<br/>He is parted from his friends<br/>While their eager eyes behold Him<br/>He upon the clouds ascends<br/>He who walked with God and pleased Him<br/>Preaching truth and doom to come<br/>He our Enoch is translated<br/>To His home - To His home<br/>To His everlasting home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Now our heavenly Aaron enters<br/>With His blood within the veil<br/>Joshua now is come to Canaan<br/>And the kings before Him quail<br/>Now He plants the tribes of Israel<br/>In their promised resting-place<br/>Now ourt great Elijah offers<br/>Of His grace - of His grace<br/>Double portion of His grace</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He has raised our human nature<br/>On the clouds to God's right hand<br/>There we sit in heav'nly places<br/>There with Him in glory stand<br/>Jesus reigns adored by angels<br/>Man with God is on the throne<br/>Mighty Lord inThine ascension<br/>We by faith - We by faith<br/>We by faith behold our own</lines>
