      <lines>Precious is the Lamb<br/>Pure beyond description<br/>Who took our affliction<br/>carried it to the cross<br/>Offering up His life<br/>Oh by the grace believe Him<br/>By His grace receive<br/>His living water now.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Precious is the Lamb<br/>who purchased our redemption<br/>Beyond our comprehension is His boundless Love<br/>We receive His Life<br/>we receive His healing<br/>By His grace revealing all the Father's love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Precious is the Lamb<br/>slain but now He's risen<br/>Who freed the souls in prison<br/>Set them soaring free<br/>Gentle as a dove<br/>mighty as the thunder<br/>We bow down in wonder<br/>as He takes His Throne<br/>We bow down in wonder<br/>as He takes His Throne</lines>
