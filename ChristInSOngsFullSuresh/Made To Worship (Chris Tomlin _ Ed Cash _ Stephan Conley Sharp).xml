    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>G<br/>Before the day before the light<br/>Before the world revolved around the sun<br/>God on high stepped down into time<br/>And wrote the story<br/>Of His love for everyone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>He has filled our hearts with wonder<br/>So that we always remember</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>You and I are made to worship<br/>You and I are called to love<br/>You and I are forgiven and free<br/>When you and I embrace surrender<br/>When you and I choose to believe<br/>Then you and I will see<br/>(You and I will see)<br/>Who we were meant to be</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All we are and all we have<br/>Is all a gift from God that we receive<br/>Brought to life we open up our eyes<br/>To see the majesty and glory of the King</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Even the rocks cry out<br/>Even the heavens shout<br/>At the sound of His Holy name<br/>So let ev'ry voice sing out<br/>Let ev'ry knee bow down<br/>He's worthy of all our praise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>Yeah we were meant to be oo<br/>You and I you and I<br/>Yeah yeah oo<br/>We were meant to be</lines>
    </verse>
