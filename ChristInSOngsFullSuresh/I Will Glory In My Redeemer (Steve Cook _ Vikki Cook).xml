    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I will glory in my Redeemer<br/>Whose priceless blood has ransomed me<br/>Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails<br/>And hung Him on that judgment tree<br/>I will glory in my Redeemer<br/>Who crushed the power of sin and death<br/>My only Savior before the holy Judge<br/>The Lamb Who is my righteousness<br/>The Lamb Who is my righteousness</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I will glory in my Redeemer<br/>My life He bought my love He owns<br/>I have no longings for another<br/>I'm satisfied in Him alone<br/>I will glory in my Redeemer<br/>His faithfulness my standing place<br/>Though foes are mighty and rush upon me<br/>My feet are firm held by His grace<br/>My feet are firm held by His grace</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I will glory in my Redeemer<br/>Who carries me on eagle's wings<br/>He crowns my life with loving kindness<br/>His triumph song I'll ever sing<br/>I will glory in my Redeemer<br/>Who waits for me at gates of gold<br/>And when He calls me it will be paradise<br/>His face forever to behold<br/>His face forever to behold</lines>
