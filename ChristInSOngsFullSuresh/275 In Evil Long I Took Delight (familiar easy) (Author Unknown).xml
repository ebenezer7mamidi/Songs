    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In evil long I took delight<br/>Unawed by shame or fear<br/>Till a new object struck my sight<br/>And stopped my wild career</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I saw One hanging on a tree<br/>In agony and blood<br/>Who fixed His languid eyes on me<br/>As near his cross I stood</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sure never to my latest breath<br/>Can I forget that look<br/>It seemed to charge me with his death<br/>Though not a word He spoke</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>My conscience felt and owned the guilt<br/>And plunged me in despair<br/>I saw my sins His blood had spilt<br/>And helped to nail Him there</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Alas I knew not what I did<br/>But now my tears are vain<br/>Where shall my trembling soul be hid<br/>For I the Lord have slain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>A second look He gave which said<br/>I freely all forgive<br/>This blood is for thy ransom paid<br/>I die that thou mayst live</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Thus while His death my sin displays<br/>In all its blackest hue<br/>Such is the mystery of grace<br/>It seals my pardon too</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>With pleasing grief and mournful joy<br/>My spirit now is filled<br/>That I should such a life destroy<br/>Yet live by Him I killed</lines>
    </verse>
