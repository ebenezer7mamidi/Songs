    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Our goal the holy city with the Lord<br/>It is our portion 'tis where He's adored<br/>Although our bodies still are living here<br/>Our spirits with our glorious Lord are there<br/>Our spirits with our glorious Lord are there</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Our goal divine the new Jerusalem<br/>That holy city made for God with men<br/>For all redeemed who have Thy pathway trod<br/>Shall have the right to share the bliss with God<br/>Shall have the right to share the bliss with God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And every time we toward that city gaze<br/>Then every time we long to see Thy face<br/>We long to hear the shout that calls to Thee<br/>With Thee to share Thy God eternally<br/>With Thee to share Thy God eternally</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Our heart's desire is not the peace so sweet<br/>Our longed for hope is not the joy we'll meet<br/>But Thou Thyself Thou art "our hope" O Lord<br/>For 'tis Thyself that will be our reward<br/>For 'tis Thyself that will be our reward</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>O Jesus Lord we pray Thee hear our cry<br/>Come bring us to that city from on high<br/>That in that glory we may share with Thee<br/>Thy loving Self partake eternally<br/>Thy loving Self partake eternally</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>O Lord Thou sayest "I make all things new"<br/>New heav'ns new earth and all within them<br/>Our God Himself our portion then shall be<br/>O Lord come quickly take us up with Thee<br/>O Lord come quickly take us up with Thee</lines>
