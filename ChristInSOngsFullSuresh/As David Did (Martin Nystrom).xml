    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As David did in Jehovah's sight<br/>I will dance with all my might<br/>Before the King of kings<br/>As Miriam did with the tambourine<br/>I will clap my hands and sing<br/>Before the King of kings</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>We can come before Him<br/>And worship Him today<br/>We can now adore Him<br/>Jesus made a way</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>As Judah did on the battle ground<br/>We will make a joyful sound<br/>Before the King of kings<br/>As Joshua did at Jericho<br/>We will shout to defeat the foe<br/>Before the King of kings</lines>
