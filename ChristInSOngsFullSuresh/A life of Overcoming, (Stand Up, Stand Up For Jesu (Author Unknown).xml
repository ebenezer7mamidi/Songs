    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>G<br/>A life of Overcoming,<br/>A life of ceaseless praise,<br/>Be this thy blessed portion<br/>Throughout the coming days.<br/>The victory was purchased<br/>On Calv'rys cross for thee,<br/>Sin shall not have dominion,<br/>The Son hath made thee free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And would'st thou know the secret <br/>Of constant victory?<br/>Let in the Overcomer, <br/>And He will conquer thee!<br/>Thy broken spirit taken<br/>In sweet captivity<br/>Shall glory in His triumph <br/>And share His victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Though all the path before thee,<br/>The host of darkness fill,<br/>Look to thy Father's promise,<br/>And claim the vict'ry still.<br/>Faith sees the heavenly legions,<br/>Where doubt sees nought but foes,<br/>And through the very conflict<br/>Her life the stronger grows.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>More stern will grow the conflict<br/>As nears our King's return,<br/>And they alone can face it<br/>Who this great lesson learn:<br/>That from them God asks nothing<br/>But to unlatch the door<br/>Admitting Him who through them,<br/>Will conquer evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
