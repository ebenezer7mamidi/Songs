    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Father I know that all my life<br/>Is portioned out for me<br/>The changes that will surely come<br/>I do not fear to see<br/>I ask Thee for a present mind<br/>Intent on pleasing Thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I ask Thee for a thoughtful love<br/>Through constant watching wise<br/>To meet the glad with joyful smiles<br/>To wipe the weeping eyes<br/>A heart at leisure from itself<br/>To soothe and sympathize</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I would not have the restless will<br/>That hurries to and fro<br/>Seeking for some great thing to do<br/>Or secret thing to know<br/>I would be treated as a child<br/>And guided where I go</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Wherever in the world I am<br/>In what-soe'er estate<br/>I have a fellowship with hearts<br/>To keep and cultivate<br/>A work of lowly love to do<br/>For Him on whom I wait</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I ask Thee for the daily strength<br/>To none that ask denied<br/>A mind to blend with outward life<br/>While keeping at Thy side<br/>Content to fill a little space<br/>If Thou be glorified</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>On every path there is untruth<br/>That I might patient be<br/>In every way there is a cross<br/>That I might lean on Thee<br/>A lowly heart will find each place<br/>A paradise for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>And if some things I ask not in<br/>My cup of blessing be<br/>I'd have my spirit filled the more<br/>With grateful love to Thee<br/>More careful-not to serve Thee much<br/>But please Thee perfectly</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>In service which Thy will appoints<br/>There are no bonds for me<br/>My inmost heart is taught the truth<br/>That makes Thy children free<br/>A life of self-renouncing love<br/>Is one of liberty</lines>
    </verse>
