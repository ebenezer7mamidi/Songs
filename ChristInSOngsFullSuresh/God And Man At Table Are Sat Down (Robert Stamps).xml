    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O welcome all ye noble saints of old<br/>As now before your very eyes unfold<br/>That wonders all so long ago foretold<br/>God and man at table are sat down<br/>God and man at table are sat down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Elders martyrs all are falling down<br/>And prophets patriarchs are gathering round<br/>What angels longed to see now man has found<br/>God and man at table are sat down<br/>God and man at table are sat down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Beggars lame and harlots also here<br/>Repentant publicans are drawing near<br/>Wayward sons come home without a fear<br/>God and man at table are sat down<br/>God and man at table are sat down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Who is this who spreads the victory feast<br/>Who is this who makes our warring cease<br/>Jesus risen Saviour Prince of Peace<br/>God and man at table are sat down<br/>God and man at table are sat down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Here He gives Himself to us as bread<br/>Here as wine we drink the blood He shed<br/>Born to die we eat and live instead<br/>God and man at table are sat down<br/>God and man at table are sat down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Worship in the presence of the Lord<br/>With joyful songs and hearts in one accord<br/>And let our Host of table be adored<br/>God and man at table are sat down<br/>God and man at table are sat down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>When at last this earth shall pass away<br/>When Jesus and His bride are one to stay<br/>The feast of love is just begun that day<br/>God and man at table are sat down<br/>God and man at table are sat down</lines>
