    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You did not have a home<br/>there were places You visited frequently<br/>You'd take off Your shoes and scratch Your feet<br/>cause You knew the whole world belonged to the meek<br/>but You did not have a home<br/>no You did not have a home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So You did not take a wife<br/>there were pretty maids all in a row<br/>lined up to touch the hem of Your robe<br/>but You had no place to take them so You did not take a wife<br/>no You did not take a wife</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>birds have nests foxes have dens<br/>the Hope of the whole world rests upon the shoulders of a Homeless Man<br/>you had the shoulders of a Homeless Man<br/>you did not have a home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And You had no stones to throw<br/>you came without an ax to grind<br/>you did not tow the party line<br/>no wonder sight came to the blind<br/>you had no stones to throw<br/>no you had no stones to throw</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>so You rode an ass's fold<br/>the laid down coats and cut down palms<br/>for You and Your donkey to walk upon<br/>but the world can't find what it thinks it wants<br/>on the back of an ass's fold<br/>so i guess You had to get sold<br/>cause the world can't stand what it cannot own<br/>and it can't own You cause You did not have a home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Birds have nests foxes have dens<br/>the Hope of the whole world rests upon the shoulders of a Homeless Man<br/>You had the shoulders of a Homeless Man<br/>You did not have a home</lines>
