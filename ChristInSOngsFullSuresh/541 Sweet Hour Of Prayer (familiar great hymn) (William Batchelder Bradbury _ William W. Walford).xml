    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Bb<br/>Verse 1<br/>Sweet hour of prayer sweet hour of prayer<br/>That calls me from a world of care<br/>And bids me at my Father's throne<br/>Make all my wants and wishes known<br/>In seasons of distress and grief<br/>My soul has often found relief<br/>And oft escaped the tempter's snare<br/>By thy return sweet hour of prayer</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer sweet hour of prayer<br/>The joys I feel the bliss I share<br/>Of those whose anxious spirits burn<br/>With strong desires for thy return<br/>With such I hasten to the place<br/>Where God my Savior shows His face<br/>And gladly take my station there<br/>And wait for thee sweet hour of prayer</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer sweet hour of prayer<br/>Thy wings shall my petition bear<br/>To Him whose truth and faithfulness<br/>Engage the waiting soul to bless<br/>And since He bids me seek His face<br/>Believe His Word and trust His grace<br/>I'll cast on Him my ev'ry care<br/>And wait for thee sweet hour of prayer</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer sweet hour of prayer<br/>May I thy consolation share<br/>Till from Mount Pisgah's lofty height<br/>I view my home and take my flight<br/>This robe of flesh I'll drop and rise<br/>To seize the everlasting prize<br/>And shout while passing through the air<br/>Farewell farewell sweet hour of prayer</lines>
    </verse>
