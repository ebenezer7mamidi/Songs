    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>E<br/>I'm pressing on the upward way<br/>New heights I'm gaining ev'ry day<br/>Still praying as I'm onward bound<br/>Lord plant my feet on higher ground<br/>Lord lift me up and let me stand<br/>by faith on heaven's table land<br/>a higher plane than I have found<br/>Lord plant my feet on higher ground</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>My heart has no desire to stay<br/>Where doubts arise and fears dismay<br/>Though some may dwell where these abound<br/>My prayer my aim is higher ground<br/>Lord lift me up and let me stand<br/>by faith on heaven's table land<br/>a higher plane than I have found<br/>Lord plant my feet on higher ground</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I want to live above the world<br/>though Satan's darts at me are hurled<br/>for faith has caught the joyful sound<br/>the song of saints on higher ground<br/>Lord lift me up and let me stand<br/>by faith on heaven's table land<br/>a higher plane than I have found<br/>Lord plant my feet on higher ground</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I want to scale the utmost height<br/>and catch a gleam of glory bright<br/>but I'll still pray 'till heaven I've found<br/>Lord lead me on to higher ground<br/>Lord lift me up and let me stand<br/>by faith on heaven's table land<br/>a higher plane than I have found<br/>Lord plant my feet on higher ground</lines>
