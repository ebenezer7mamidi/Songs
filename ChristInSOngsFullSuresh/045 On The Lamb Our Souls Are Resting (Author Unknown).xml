    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>On the Lamb our souls are resting<br/>What His love no tongue can say<br/>All our sins so great so many<br/>In His blood are washed away</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sweetest rest and peace have filled us<br/>Sweeter praise than tongue can tell<br/>God is satisfied with Jesus<br/>We are satisfied as well</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Conscience now no more condemns us<br/>For His own most precious blood<br/>Once for all has washed and cleansed us<br/>Cleansed us in the eyes of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Filled with this sweet peace forever<br/>On we go through strife and care<br/>Till we find that peace around us<br/>In the Lamb's high glory there</lines>
    </verse>
