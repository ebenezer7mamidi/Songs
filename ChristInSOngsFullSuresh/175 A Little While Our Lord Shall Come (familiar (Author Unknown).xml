    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>"A little while"—He'll come again,<br/>Let us the precious hours redeem;<br/>Our only grief to give Him pain,<br/>Our joy to serve and follow Him.<br/>Watching and ready may we be,<br/>As those that wait their Lord to see.<br/>Watching and ready may we be,<br/>As those that wait their Lord to see.</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>"A little while"—'twill soon be past,<br/>Why should we shun the promised cross?<br/>Oh let us in His footsteps haste,<br/>Counting for Him all else but loss!<br/>For how will recompense His smile,<br/>The sufferings of this "little while."<br/>For how will recompense His smile,<br/>The sufferings of this "little while."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>"A little while"—come, Saviour, come!<br/>For Thee Thy bride has tarried long:<br/>Take Thy poor, waiting pilgrims home,<br/>To sing the new eternal song,<br/>To see Thy glory, and to be<br/>In everything conformed to Thee!<br/>To see Thy glory, and to be<br/>In everything conformed to Thee!</lines>
