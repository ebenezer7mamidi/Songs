    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh how dark the night that wrapt my spirit round<br/>Oh how deep the woe my Savior found<br/>When He walk'd across the waters of my soul<br/>Bade my night disperse and made me whole</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>All the way to Calvary<br/>He went for me<br/>He went for me<br/>He went for me<br/>All the way to Calvary<br/>He went for me<br/>He died to set me free</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Trembling a sinner bow'd before His face<br/>Naught I knew of pardon God's free grace<br/>Heard a voice so melting<br/>"Cease thy wild regret<br/>Jesus bought thy pardon paid thy debt"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O 'twas wondrous love the Savior show'd for me<br/>When He left His throne for Calvary<br/>When He bore my trespass bore it all alone<br/>Praise His Name forever make it known</lines>
    </verse>
