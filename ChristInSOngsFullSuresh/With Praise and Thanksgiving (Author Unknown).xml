    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>With praise and thanksgiving<br/>there stands a great throng<br/>In the presence of Jesus<br/>and sing this new song<br/>Unto Him who hath lov'd us<br/>and wash'd us from sin<br/>Unto Him be the glory forever - Amen</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All these once were sinners<br/>defiled in His sight<br/>Now arrayed in pure garments<br/>in praise they unite<br/>Unto Him who hath lov'd us<br/>and wash'd us from sin<br/>Unto Him be the glory forever - Amen</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He maketh the rebel<br/>a priest and a king<br/>He hath bought us and taught us<br/>this new song to sing<br/>Unto Him who hath lov'd us<br/>and wash'd us from sin<br/>Unto Him be the glory forever - Amen</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>How helpless and hopeless<br/>we sinners had been<br/>If He never had loved us<br/>till cleansed from our sin<br/>Unto Him who hath lov'd us<br/>and wash'd us from sin<br/>Unto Him be the glory forever - Amen</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Aloud in His praises<br/>our voices shall ring<br/>So that others believing<br/>this new song shall sing<br/>Unto Him who hath lov'd us<br/>and wash'd us from sin<br/>Unto Him be the glory forever - Amen</lines>
