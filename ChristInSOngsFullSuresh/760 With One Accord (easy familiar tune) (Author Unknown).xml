    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>"With one accord" within an upper room<br/>The faithful followers of Jesus met<br/>One was the hope of ev'ry waiting soul<br/>And on one object great each heart was set</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>"With one accord" until the mighty gift<br/>Of pentecostal power was outpoured<br/>Then forth as witnesses possessed of God<br/>To preach the resurrection of the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>"With one accord" within the house of God<br/>A hallelujah song is daily raised<br/>As with the voice of one from vocal hearts<br/>Christ Jesus' name is glorified and praised</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Pour down Thy Spirit once again dear Lord<br/>Our cry goes up to Thee for "latter rain"<br/>Unite Thy people as the "heart of one"<br/>And pentecostal days shall come again</lines>
