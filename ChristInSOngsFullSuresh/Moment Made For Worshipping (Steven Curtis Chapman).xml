    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>This is a moment made for worshipping<br/>'Cause this is a moment I'm alive<br/>And this is a moment I was made to sing<br/>A song of living sacrifice<br/>For ev'ry moment that I live and breathe<br/>This is a moment made for worshipping</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Six thirty Monday morning<br/>I'm here hiding in my bed<br/>A song plays on my alarm clock<br/>As I cover up my head<br/>And somewhere in the distance<br/>I remember yesterday<br/>Singing halleluia<br/>Full of wonder awe and praise<br/>But now I'm just wondering<br/>Why I don't feel anything at all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When I'm playing with my children<br/>As they're running off to school<br/>When I kiss my wife good morning<br/>Just to say I still love you<br/>When I'm feeling loved and happy<br/>When I'm feeling all alone<br/>When I'm failing to remember<br/>All the love that I've been shown<br/>Ev'ry beat of my heart<br/>Is another new place to start<br/>Do you know</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Every single beat of my heart<br/>Is another new place to start<br/>Right now</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>From the rising of the sun<br/>To the setting of the sun<br/>The name of the Lord<br/>Is worthy to be praised</lines>
