    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a light upon the mountains<br/>And the day is at the spring<br/>When our eyes shall see the beauty<br/>And the glory of the king<br/>Weary was our heart with waiting<br/>And the night-watch seemed so long<br/>But his triumph day is breaking<br/>And we hail it with a song</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In the fading of the starlight<br/>We can see the coming morn<br/>And the lights of men are paling<br/>In the splendors of the dawn<br/>For the eastern skies are glowing<br/>As with lights of hidden fire<br/>And the hearts of men are stirring<br/>With the throb of deep desire</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's a hush of expectation<br/>And a quiet in the air<br/>And the breath of God is moving<br/>In the fervent breath of prayer<br/>For the suffering dying Jesus<br/>Is the Christ upon the throne<br/>And the travail of our spirit<br/>Is the travail of His own</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He is breaking down the barriers<br/>He is casting up the way<br/>He is calling for His angels<br/>To build up the gates of day<br/>But His angels here are human<br/>Not the shinning hosts above<br/>For the drum-beats of His army<br/>Are the heart-beats of our love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Hark - We hear a distant music<br/>And it comes with fuller swell<br/>'Tis the triumph song of Jesus<br/>Of our King Emmanuel<br/>Zion go ye forth to meet Him<br/>And my soul be swift to bring<br/>All thy sweetest and thy dearest<br/>For the triumph of our King</lines>
    </verse>
