    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>D<br/><br/>In Christ alone my hope is found<br/>He is my light my strength my song<br/>This Cornerstone this solid ground<br/>Firm through the fiercest drought and storm</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>What heights of love what depths of peace<br/>When fears are stilled when strivings cease<br/>My comforter my all in all<br/>Here in the love of Christ I stand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>In Christ alone who took on flesh<br/>Fullness of God in helpless Babe<br/>This gift of love and righteousness<br/>Scorned by the ones He came to save</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>'Til on that cross as Jesus died<br/>The wrath of God was satisfied<br/>For ev'ry sin on Him was laid<br/>Here in the death of Christ I live</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>There in the ground His body lay<br/>Light of the world by darkness slain<br/>Then bursting forth in glorious day<br/>Up from the grave He rose again</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>And as He stands in victory<br/>Sin's curse has lost its grip on me<br/>For I am His and He is mine<br/>Bought with the precious blood of Christ</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4a">
      <lines>No guilt in life no fear in death<br/>This is the pow'r of Christ in me<br/>From life's first cry to final breath<br/>Jesus commands my destiny</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4b">
      <lines>No pow'r of hell no scheme of man<br/>Can ever pluck me from His hand<br/>'Til He returns or calls me home<br/>Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand</lines>
    </verse>
