    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.<br/>I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.<br/>I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.<br/>Filled with the Holy Ghost, I am.<br/>All my sins are washed away.<br/>I've been redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And that's not all<br/>there's more besides. (3x)<br/>I've been to the river and I've been baptized.<br/>All my sins are washed away.<br/>I've been redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>No, you can't get to heaven by your good deeds. (3x)<br/>To God they're just like garden weeds.<br/>All my sins are washed away.<br/>I've been redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>There's not much time<br/>left for us here. (3x)<br/>For Jesus' comin' is drawing near.<br/>All my sins are washed away.<br/>I've been redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I've been redeemed<br/>by the Lord above. (3x)<br/>He paid the price with His precious blood.<br/>All my sins are washed away.<br/>I've been redeemed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>You can talk about me<br/>just as much as you please. (3x)<br/>I'll talk about you down on my knees.<br/>All my sins are washed away.<br/>I've been redeemed.</lines>
