    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>No mortal tongue can e'er describe<br/>The freedom of the soul<br/>When passed beyond all earthly bribe<br/>To God's complete control<br/>All things are his yes life and death<br/>Things present or to come<br/>In Christ he draws in peace each breath<br/>In Christ he finds his home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When such as we the King can choose<br/>To share with Him His throne<br/>'Tis passing strange that we refuse<br/>To be our Lord's alone<br/>O never speak of sacrifice<br/>A privilege untold<br/>Is to be His at any price<br/>In Calv'ry's hosts enrolled</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Arise the holy bargain strike<br/>The fragment for the whole<br/>All men and all events alike<br/>Must serve the ransomed soul<br/>All things are yours when you are His<br/>And He and you are one<br/>A boundless life in Him there is<br/>Whence doubt and fear are gone</lines>
    </verse>
