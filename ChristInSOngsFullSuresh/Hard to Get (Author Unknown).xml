    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You who live in heaven<br/>Hear the prayers of those of us who live on earth<br/>Who are afraid of being left by those we love<br/>Who get hardened in the hurt<br/>Do You remember when You lived down here<br/>Where we all scrape<br/>To find the faith to ask for daily bread<br/>Did You forget about us<br/>After You had flown away<br/>Well I memorized every word You said<br/>But still I'm so scared I'm holding my breath<br/>While You're up there just playing hard to get</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You who live in radience<br/>Hear the prayers of those of us who live in skin<br/>We have a love that's not a patient as Your's was<br/>But we still love now and then<br/>Did You ever know lonliness<br/>Did You ever know need<br/>Do You remember just how long a night can get<br/>When You are barely holding on<br/>And Your friends fall asleep<br/>And don't see the blood that's runnin' in Your sweat<br/>Will those who mourn be left uncomforted<br/>While You're up there just playing hard to get</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I know You bore our sorrows<br/>And I know You feel our pain<br/>And I know that it would not hurt any less<br/>Even if it could be explained<br/>And I know that I am only lashing out<br/>At the One who loves me most<br/>And after I have figured this somehow<br/>What I really need to know.....</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Is if You who live in eternity<br/>Hear the prayers of those of us who live in time<br/>We can't see what's ahead<br/>And we cannot get free from what we've left behind<br/>I'm reeling from these voices that Keep screaming in my ears<br/>All these words of shame and doubt, blame and regret<br/>I can't see how You're leading me<br/>Unless You've lead me here<br/>To where I'm lost enough to let myself be led<br/>So You've been here all along I guess<br/>It's just Your ways and You are just plain hard to get</lines>
