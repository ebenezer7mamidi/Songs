    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>There is always something over<br/>When we from our Father's hand<br/>Take our portion with thanksgiving<br/>Praising for the things He planned<br/>Satisfaction full and deepening<br/>All our need He doth supply</lines>

    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>We can only praise and wonder<br/>And His name forever bless<br/>We can only praise and wonder<br/>And His name forever bless</lines>
