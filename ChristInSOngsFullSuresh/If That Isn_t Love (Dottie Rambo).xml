    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He left the splendor of heaven<br/>Knowing His destiny<br/>Was the lonely hill of Golgotha<br/>There to lay down His life for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>If that isn't love<br/>The ocean is dry<br/>There's no star in the sky<br/>And the sparrow can't fly<br/>If that isn't love<br/>Then heaven's a myth<br/>There's no feeling like this<br/>If that isn't love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Even in death He remembered<br/>The thief hanging by His side<br/>He spoke with love and compassion<br/>Then He took him to paradise</lines>
    </verse>
