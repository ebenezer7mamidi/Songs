    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>O Christ, He is the fountain<br/>The deep sweet well of love!<br/>The streams on earth I've tasted<br/>More deep I'll drink above:<br/>There to an ocean fullness His mercy doth expand,<br/>And glory, glory dwelleth<br/>In Emmanuel's land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>The bride eyes not her garment,<br/>But her dear Bridegroom's face;<br/>I will not gaze at glory<br/>But on my King of grace<br/>Not at the crown He giveth<br/>But on His pierced hand;<br/>The Lamb is all the glory<br/>Of Emmanuel's land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1c">
      <lines>O I am my Beloved's<br/>And my Beloved's mine!<br/>He brings a poor vile sinner<br/>Into His house of wine<br/>I stand upon His merit -<br/>I know no other stand,<br/>Not e'en where glory dwelleth<br/>In Emmanuel's land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1d">
      <lines>Deep waters cross'd life's pathway<br/>A hedge of thorns has torn<br/>With mercy and with judgement<br/>His plan for me I've born<br/>I'll bless His hand upon me<br/>I'll bless the heart that plann'd,<br/>I'll trust, He's never failed me<br/>In Immanuel's land.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1e">
      <lines>I've borne the scorn and hatred<br/>I've borne the wrong shame,<br/>Earth's proud ones have reproached me,<br/>For Christ's thrice blessed name;<br/>Where God His seal set fairest<br/>They've stamp'd their foulest brand;<br/>But judgement shines like noonday<br/>In Immanuel's land.</lines>
    </verse>
