      <lines>Come and rejoice with me<br/>For once my heart was poor<br/>And I have found a treasury<br/>Of love a boundless store</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Come and rejoice with me<br/>I once so sick at heart<br/>Have met with One<br/>who knows my case<br/>And knows the healing art</lines>
    </verse>

      <lines>Come and rejoice with me<br/>For I was wearied sore<br/>And I have found a mighty arm<br/>Which holds me evermore</lines>

    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come and rejoice with me<br/>My feet so wide did roam<br/>And One has brought me from afar<br/>And beareth me safely home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Come and rejoice with me<br/>For I have found a Friend<br/>Who knows my heart's most secret depths<br/>Yet loves me without end</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>I knew not of His love<br/>And He had loved so long<br/>With love so faithful and so deep<br/>So tender and so strong</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>And now I know His love<br/>Have heard and known His voice<br/>And hear it still from day to day<br/>Can I enough rejoice</lines>
