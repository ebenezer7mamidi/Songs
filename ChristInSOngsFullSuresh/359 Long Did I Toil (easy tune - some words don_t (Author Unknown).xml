    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Long did I toil and knew no earthly rest<br/>Far did I rove and found no certain home<br/>At last I sought them in His sheltering breast<br/>Who spreads His arms<br/>And bids the weary come<br/>With Him I found a home a rest divine<br/>And I since then am His and He is mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Yes He is mine and naught of earthly things<br/>Not all the charms of pleasure wealth or power<br/>The fame of heroes<br/>Or the pomp of kings<br/>Could tempt me to forego His love an hour<br/>Go worthless world I cry with all that's thine<br/>Go I my Savior's am and He is mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The good I have is from His store supplied<br/>The ill is only what he deems the best<br/>With Him my Friend<br/>I'm rich with nought beside<br/>And poor without Him<br/>Though of all possessed<br/>Changes may come - I take or I resign<br/>Content while I am His while He is mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Whate'er may change in Him no change is seen<br/>A glorious Sun that wanes not nor declines<br/>Above the clouds and storms He walks serene<br/>And sweetly on His people's darkness shines<br/>All may depart - I fret not nor repine<br/>While I my Savior's am while He is mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He stays me falling<br/>Lifts me up when down<br/>Reclaims me wandering guards from every foe<br/>Plants on my worthless brow the victor's crown<br/>Which in return before His feet I throw<br/>Grieved that I cannot better grace His shrine<br/>Who deigns to own me His<br/>As He is mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>While here alas I know but half His love<br/>But half discern Him and but half adore<br/>But when I meet Him in the realms above<br/>I hope to love Him better praise Him more<br/>And feel and tell amid the choir divine<br/>How fully I am His and He is mine</lines>
    </verse>
