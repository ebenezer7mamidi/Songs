    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Every knee shall bow before Him<br/>Every tongue confess His name<br/>Ransomed myriads shall adore Him<br/>Who endured the sinner's shame<br/>From the glory - From the glory<br/>God doth now His worth proclaim</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Man the cross to Him awarded<br/>Man the Savior crucified<br/>This world's judgment stands recorded<br/>God's own justice satisfied<br/>By the glory - By the glory<br/>Christ was claimed on earth who died</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Son of Man His incarnation<br/>Opened first the tale of grace<br/>Son of Man in new creation<br/>Leader of a chose race<br/>Well May glory - Well may glory<br/>Crown Him in the highest place</lines>
