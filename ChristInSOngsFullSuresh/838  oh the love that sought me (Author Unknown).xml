    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>E<br/>Verse 1<br/>In tenderness He sought me<br/>Weary and sick with sin<br/>And on His shoulders brought me<br/>Back to His fold again<br/>While angels in His presence sang<br/>Until the courts of heaven rang</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh the love that sought me<br/>Oh the blood that bought me<br/>Oh the grace that brought me to the fold<br/>Wondrous grace that brought me to the fold</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He found me bruised and dying<br/>And poured in oil and wine<br/>He whispered to assure me<br/>I've found thee thou art Mine<br/>I never heard a sweeter voice<br/>It made my aching heart rejoice</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He pointed to the nailprints<br/>For me His blood was shed<br/>A mocking crown so thorny<br/>Was placed upon His head<br/>I wondered what He saw in me<br/>To suffer such deep agony</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I'm sitting in His presence<br/>The sunshine of His face<br/>While with adoring wonder<br/>His blessing I retrace<br/>It seems as if eternal days<br/>Are far too short to sound His praise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>So while the hours are passing<br/>All now is perfect rest<br/>I'm waiting for the morning<br/>The brightest and the best<br/>When He will call us to His side<br/>To be with Him His spotless bride</lines>
    </verse>
