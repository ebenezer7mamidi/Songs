    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Face to face with Christ my Savior<br/>Face to face what will it be<br/>When with rapture I behold Him<br/>Jesus Christ who died for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>Face to face I shall behold Him<br/>Far beyond the starry sky<br/>Face to face in all His glory<br/>I shall see Him by and by</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>Only faintly now I see Him<br/>with the darkling veil between<br/>but a blessed day is coming<br/>when His glory shall be seen</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1c">
      <lines>What rejoicing in His presence<br/>When are banished grief and pain<br/>When the crooked ways are straightened<br/>and the dark things shall be plain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1d">
      <lines>Face to face O blissful moment<br/>Face to face to see and know<br/>Face to face with my Redeemer<br/>Jesus Christ who loves me so</lines>
