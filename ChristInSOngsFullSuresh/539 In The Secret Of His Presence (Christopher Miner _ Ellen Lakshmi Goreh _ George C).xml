    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the secret of His presence<br/>How my soul delights to hide<br/>Oh how precious are the lessons<br/>Which I learn at Jesus' side<br/>Earthly cares can never vex me<br/>Neither trials lay me low<br/>For when Satan comes to tempt me<br/>To the secret place I go<br/>To the secret place I go</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When my soul is faint and thirsty<br/>'Neath the shadow of His wing<br/>There is cool and pleasant shelter<br/>And a fresh and crystal spring<br/>And my Savior rests beside me<br/>As we hold communion sweet<br/>If I tried I could not utter<br/>What He says when thus we meet<br/>What He says when thus we meet</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Only this I know I tell Him<br/>All my doubts my griefs and fears<br/>Oh how patiently He listens<br/>And my drooping soul He cheers<br/>Do you think He ne'er reproves me<br/>What a false friend He would be<br/>If He never ever told me<br/>Of the sin which He must see<br/>Of the sin which He must see</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Would you like to know that sweetness<br/>Of the secret of the Lord<br/>Go and hide beneath His shadow<br/>This shall then be your reward<br/>And whene'er you leave the silence<br/>Of that happy meeting-place<br/>You will surely bear the image<br/>Of the Master in your face<br/>Of the Master in your face</lines>
    </verse>
