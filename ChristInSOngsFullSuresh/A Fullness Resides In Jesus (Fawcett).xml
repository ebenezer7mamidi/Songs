    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>F<br/>A fullness resides in Jesus our Head<br/>A fullness abides to answer all need:<br/>The Father's good pleasure<br/>has laid up a store,<br/>A plentiful treasure, to give to the poor.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Whatever distress awaits us below,<br/>Such plentiful grace the Lord will bestow,<br/>As still shall support us and silence our fear,<br/>And nothing can hurt us while Jesus is near.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When sorrows assail us, or terrors draw nigh,<br/>His love will not fail us, He'll guard with His eye;<br/>And when we are fainting and ready to fail,<br/>He'll give what is wanting, and make us prevail.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We trust in His protection; we'll lean on His might;<br/>We're sure His direction will guide us aright:<br/>We know who surrounds us, almighty to save;<br/>And no one confounds us the Saviour who have.</lines>
