    </verse>

      <lines>My gracious Master and my God,<br/>Assist me to proclaim,<br/>To spread through all the earth abroad,<br/>The honors of Thy Name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus! the name that charms our fears,<br/>That bids our sorrows cease;<br/>'Tis music in the sinner's ears,<br/>'Tis life, and health, and peace</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>His love my heart has captive made<br/>His captive would I be<br/>for He was bound and scourged and died<br/>My captive soul to free</lines>

    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>He breaks the power of canceled sin,<br/>He sets the prisoner free;<br/>His blood can make the foulest clean;<br/>His blood availed for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>So now Thy blessed Name I love<br/>Thy will would e'er be mine<br/>Had I a thousand hearts to give<br/>My Lord they all were Thine</lines>
