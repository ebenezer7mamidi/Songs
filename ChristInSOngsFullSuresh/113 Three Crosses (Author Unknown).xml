    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>three crosses stood grimly<br/>side by side<br/>on the hill of Calvary<br/>on each a suff'ring man had died<br/>two for their crimes<br/>the other for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>like a lamb they led Him out to die<br/>from shades of Gathsemane<br/>he uttered no moan no bitter cry<br/>'Twas love that moved Him to die for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>on the central cross they nailed my Friend<br/>to languish in agony<br/>he bore it all to the bitter end<br/>o wonderful love He died for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>if thou art the christ they taunting said<br/>come down from the cursed tree<br/>he heeded no jeering word they said<br/>but bowing His head He died for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>like a wondering sheep i had gone astray<br/>but all my iniquity<br/>my god laid on Him that aweful day<br/>when bearing my sins He died for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>oh thanks for the love that brought Him down<br/>love fathomless like the sea<br/>his brow was pierced by a thorny crown<br/>that a crown of life might be given me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>my brother behold Him crucified<br/>on the cross of Calvary<br/>thy ransom see in that crimson tide<br/>oh freely it flowed for you and me</lines>
    </verse>
