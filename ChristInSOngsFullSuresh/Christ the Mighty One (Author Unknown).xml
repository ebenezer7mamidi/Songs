    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>D<br/>For forty days in full array we heard the giant cry,<br/>Cursing God and God's own men who stood there terrified,<br/>Until we saw the Mighty One cut off the giant's head,<br/>And then we knew the battle won whatever lay ahead.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Day to day we find our flesh oppose us to our face -<br/>Threatening to overwhelm and take God's rightful place.<br/>But our Old Man was crucified with Christ on Calvary!<br/>Arise, O Church, and shout in praise, and claim His victory!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>When we believe, it doesn't matter how the battle seems,<br/>For we believe that Jesus Christ has won the victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! The Mighty One is King!<br/>Firmly seated on the throne as Lord of everything!<br/>As yet we hope but do not see all things beneth His feet,<br/>But we proclaim until that day His victory's complete!</lines>
