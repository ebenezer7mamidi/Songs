    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Down in the valley<br/>With my Saviour I would go<br/>Where the flowers are blooming<br/>And the sweet waters flow<br/>Everywhere He leads me<br/>I would follow follow on<br/>Walking in His footsteps<br/>Till the crown be won</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Follow follow I would follow Jesus<br/>Anywhere everywhere I will follow on<br/>Follow follow I would follow Jesus<br/>Everywhere He leads me I would follow on</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Down in the valley<br/>With my Saviour I would go<br/>Where the storms are sweeping<br/>And the dark waters flow<br/>With His hand to lead me<br/>I will never never fear<br/>Danger cannot fright me<br/>If my Lord is near</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Down in the valley<br/>Or upon the mountain steep<br/>Close beside my Savior<br/>Would my heart ever keep<br/>He will lead me safely<br/>In the path that He has trod<br/>Up to where they gather<br/>On the hills of God</lines>
    </verse>
