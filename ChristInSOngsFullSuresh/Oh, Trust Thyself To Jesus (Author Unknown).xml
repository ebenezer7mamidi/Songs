    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus <br/>When conscious of thy sin,<br/>Its heavy weight upon thee,<br/>Its mighty pow'r with-in,<br/>Then is the hour for pleading <br/>His finished work for thee;<br/>Then is the time for singing, <br/>His blood was shed for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus<br/>When tempted to transgress,<br/>By word or look of anger, <br/>Or thought of bitterness;<br/>Then is the hour for claiming <br/>Thy Lord to fight for thee;<br/>Then is the time for singing,<br/>He doth deliver me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus <br/>When daily cares perplex,<br/>And trifles seem so mighty <br/>Thy inner soul to vex;<br/>Then is the hour for grasping <br/>His hand who walked the sea;<br/>Then is the time for singing, <br/>He makes it calm for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus <br/>When thou art wearied sore,<br/>When head or hand refuses <br/>To think or labor more;<br/>Then is the hour for leaning <br/>Upon the Master's breast;<br/>Then is the time for singing, <br/>My Savior gives me rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus<br/>When thou art full of care,<br/>For loved ones still refusing <br/>Our blessed hope to share<br/>Then is the hour for trusting<br/>Thy Lord to bring them nigh<br/>Then is the time for singing, <br/>He loves them more than I.</lines>
