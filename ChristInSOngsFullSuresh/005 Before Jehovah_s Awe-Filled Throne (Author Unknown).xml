    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Before Jehovah's awe- filled throne<br/>Ye nations bow with sacred joy<br/>Know that the Lord is God alone<br/>He can create and He destroy<br/>He can create and He destroy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His sovereign pow'r without our aid<br/>Made us of dust and formed us men<br/>And when like wand'ring sheep we strayed<br/>He brought us to His fold agian<br/>He brought us to His fold again</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We are His people<br/>We His care<br/>Our souls and all our mortal frame<br/>What lasting honors shall we rear<br/>Almighty Maker to Thy name<br/>Almighty Maker to Thy name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We'll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs<br/>High as the heav'ns our voices raise<br/>And earth with her ten thousand tounges<br/>Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise<br/>Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Wide as the world is Thy command<br/>Vast as eternity Thy love<br/>Firm as a rock Thy truth must stand<br/>When rolling years shall cease to move<br/>When rolling years shall cease to move</lines>
    </verse>
