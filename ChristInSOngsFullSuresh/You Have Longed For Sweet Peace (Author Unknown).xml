    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You have longed for sweet peace<br/>and for faith to increase<br/>And have earnestly fervently prayed <br/>But you cannot have rest or be perfectly blest- <br/>Until all on the altar is laid</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid<br/>Your heart does the Spirit control<br/>You can only be blest and<br/>have peace and sweet rest <br/>As you yield Him your body and soul</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Would you walk with<br/>the Lord in the light of His Word<br/>And have peace and contentment always<br/>You must do His sweet will<br/>to be free from all ill<br/>On the altar your all you must lay</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh we never can know<br/>What the Lord will bestow <br/>Of the blessings for which we have prayed <br/>Till our body and soul<br/>He doth fully control<br/>And our all on the<br/>Altar is laid</lines>
    </verse>
