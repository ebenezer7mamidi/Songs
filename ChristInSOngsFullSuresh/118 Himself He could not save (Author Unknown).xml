    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>E<br/>Himself He could not save,<br/>He on the cross must die,<br/>Or mercy could not come<br/>To ruined sinners nigh;<br/>Yes, Christ, the Son of God, must bleed,<br/>That sinners might from sin be freed,<br/>That sinners might from sin be freed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Himself He could not save,<br/>For justice must be done<br/>Our sins' full weight must fall<br/>Upon the sinless One;<br/>For nothing less can God accept<br/>In payment of that fearful debt,<br/>In payment of that fearful debt.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Himself He could not save,<br/>For He the Surety stood<br/>For all who now rely<br/>Upon His precious blood;<br/>He bore the penalty of guilt<br/>When on the cross His blood was spilt,<br/>When on the cross His blood was spilt.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Himself He could not save,<br/>What wondrous love is this!<br/>In love Himself He gave,<br/>There ne'er was love like His!<br/>Such love should melt a heart of stone<br/>Till praise flows forth to Him alone!<br/>Till praise flows forth to Him alone!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Himself He could not save,<br/>Love's stream too deeply flowed,<br/>In love Himself He gave,<br/>To pay the debt we owed.<br/>Obedience to His Father's will,<br/>And love to Him did all fulfill,<br/>And love to Him did all fulfill.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>And now exalted high<br/>A Prince and Savior He,<br/>That sinners might draw nigh<br/>And drink of mercy free,<br/>Of mercy now so richly shed,<br/>For Jesus liveth who was dead,<br/>For Jesus liveth who was dead.</lines>
    </verse>
