    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In loving kindness Jesus came<br/>My soul in mercy to reclaim<br/>And from the depths of sin and shame<br/>Thru grace He lifted me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>From sinking sand He lifted me<br/>With tender hand He lifted me<br/>From shades of night to plains of light<br/>Oh praise His name He lifted me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He called me long before I heard<br/>Before my sinful heart was stirred<br/>But when I took Him at His word<br/>Forgiv'n He lifted me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His brow was pierced with many a thorn<br/>His hands by cruel nails were torn<br/>When from my guilt and grief forlorn<br/>In love He lifted me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Now on a higher plane I dwell<br/>And with my soul I know 'tis well<br/>Yet how or why I cannot tell<br/>He should have lifted me</lines>
    </verse>
