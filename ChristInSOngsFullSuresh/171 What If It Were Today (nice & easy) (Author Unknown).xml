    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus is comming to earth again<br/>What if it were today<br/>Coming in power and love to reign<br/>What if it were today<br/>Coming to claim His chosen bride<br/>All the redeemed and purified<br/>Over this whole earth scattered wide<br/>What if it were today</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Glory Glory<br/>Joy to my heart 'twill bring<br/>Glory Glory<br/>When we shall crown Him King<br/>Glory Glory<br/>Haste to prepare the way<br/>Glory Glory<br/>Jesus will come some day</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Satan's dominion will soon be o'er<br/>O that it were today<br/>Sorrow and sighing shall be no more<br/>O that it were today<br/>Then shall the dead in Christ arise<br/>Caught up to meet Him in the skies<br/>When shall these glories meet our eyes<br/>What if it were today</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Faithful and true would He find us here<br/>If He should come today?<br/>Watching in gladness and not in fear<br/>If He should come today<br/>Signs of His coming multiply<br/>Morning light breaks in eastern sky<br/>Watch for that time is drawing nigh<br/>What if it were today</lines>
    </verse>
