    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>C<br/>Loved with everlasting Love<br/>Led by grace that love to know<br/>Spirit breathing from above<br/>Thou hast taught me it is so<br/>Oh this full and perfect peace<br/>Oh this transport all divine<br/>In a love which cannot cease<br/>I am His and He is mine<br/>In a love which cannot cease<br/>I am His and He is mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Heaven above is softer blue<br/>Earth around is sweeter green<br/>Something lives in every hue<br/>Christless eyes have never seen<br/>Birds with gladder songs o'er flow<br/>Flow'rs with deeper beauties shine<br/>Since I know as now I know<br/>I am His and He is mine<br/>Since I know as now I know<br/>I am His and He is mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Things that once were wild alarms<br/>Cannot now disturb my rest<br/>Closed in everlasting arms<br/>Pillowed on the loving breast<br/>Oh to lie forever here<br/>Doubt and care and self resign<br/>While He whispers in my ear<br/>I am His and He is mine<br/>While He whispers in my ear<br/>I am His and He is mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>His forever only His<br/>Who the Lord and me shall part<br/>Ah with what a rest of bliss<br/>Christ can fill the loving heart<br/>Heaven and earth may fade and flee<br/>Firstborn light in gloom decline<br/>But while God and I shall be<br/>I am His and He is mine<br/>But while God and I shall be<br/>I am His and He is mine</lines>
