    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When the music fades<br/>All is stripped away<br/>And I simply come<br/>Longing just to bring<br/>Something that's of worth<br/>That will bless Your heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1">
      <lines>I'll bring You more than a song<br/>For a song in itself<br/>Is not what You have required<br/>You search much deeper within<br/>Through the way things appear<br/>You're looking into my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I'm coming back<br/>To the heart of worship<br/>And it's all about You<br/>All about You Jesus<br/>I'm sorry Lord<br/>For the thing I've made it<br/>When it's all about You<br/>All about You Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>King of endless worth<br/>No one could express<br/>How much You deserve<br/>Though I'm weak and poor<br/>All I have is Yours<br/>Ev'ry single breath</lines>
    </verse>
