    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How can I say thanks for the things<br/>You have done for me<br/>Things so undeserved<br/>Yet You give to prove Your love for me<br/>The voices of a million angels<br/>Could not express my gratitude<br/>All that I am and ever hope to be<br/>I owe it all to Thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>To God be the glory<br/>To God be the glory<br/>To God be the glory<br/>For the things He has done<br/>With His blood He has saved me<br/>With His pow'r He has raised me<br/>To God be the glory<br/>For the things He has done</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Just let me live my life<br/>Let it be pleasing Lord to Thee<br/>And should I gain any praise<br/>Let it go to Calvary<br/>With His blood He has saved me<br/>With His pow'r He has raised me<br/>To God be the glory<br/>For the things He has done</lines>
