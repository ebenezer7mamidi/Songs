  <lyrics>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>So listen to our hearts<br/>Hear our spirits sing<br/>A song of praise that flows<br/>From those You have redeemed<br/>We will use the words we know<br/>To tell You what an awesome God You are<br/>But words are not enough<br/>To tell You of our love<br/>So listen to our hearts</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How do you explain<br/>How do you describe<br/>A love that goes from east to west<br/>And runs as deep as it is wide<br/>You know all our hopes<br/>Lord You know all our fears<br/>And words cannot express<br/>The love we feel<br/>But we long for You to hear</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>If words could fall like rain<br/>From these lips of mine<br/>And if I had a thousand years<br/>Lord I would still run out of time<br/>If You listen to my heart<br/>Every beat will say<br/>Thank You for the life<br/>Thank You for the truth<br/>Thank You for the way</lines>
    </verse>
