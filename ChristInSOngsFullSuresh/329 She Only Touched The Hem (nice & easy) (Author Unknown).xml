    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>She only touch'd the hem<br/>Of His garment<br/>As to His side she stole<br/>Amid the crowd<br/>that gather'd around Him<br/>And straight way<br/>She was whole</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh touch the hem<br/>Of His garment<br/>And thou too shall be free<br/>His saving pow'r<br/>This very hour<br/>Shall give new life to thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>She came in fear<br/>And trembling before Him<br/>She knew<br/>Her Lord had come<br/>She felt that from Him<br/>Virtue had healed her<br/>The mighty deed<br/>Was done</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He turned with daughter<br/>Be of good comfort<br/>Thy faith hath<br/>Made thee whole<br/>And peace that<br/>Passeth all understanding<br/>With gladness<br/>Filled her soul</lines>
