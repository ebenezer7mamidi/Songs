      <lines>A<br/><br/>The chimes of time ring out the news<br/>Another day is through<br/>Someone slipped and fell was that someone you<br/>You may have longed for added strength<br/>Your courage to renew<br/>Do not be disheartened for I have news for you</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>It is no secret what God can do<br/>What He's done for others He'll do for you<br/>With arms open wide He'll pardon you<br/>It is no secret what God can do</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There is no night for in His light<br/>You'll never walk alone<br/>Always feel at home wherever you may roam<br/>There is no power can conquer you<br/>When God is on your side<br/>Just take Him at His promise don't run away and hide</lines>
