    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He shall reign o'er all the earth<br/>He who wore the crown of thorn<br/>Whom they deemed of lirttle worth<br/>Whom they met with hate and scorn<br/>Send the tidings forth that all<br/>Humbly at His feet may fall</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Long His heritage hath lain<br/>'Neath the false usurper's sway<br/>He will claim it back again<br/>Rout the foes and win the day<br/>Send the tidings forth that all<br/>Humbly at His feet may fall</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Then beneath His rule of peace<br/>Heaven shall smile and earth shall sing<br/>Ever yielding rich increase<br/>To the honor of her King<br/>Send the tididngs forth that all<br/>Humbly at His feet may fall</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Hasten Lord the wondrous hour<br/>Bid it strike from shore to shore<br/>Thine the kingdom and the power<br/>Thiner the glory evermore<br/>Bow each rebel heart that all<br/>At Thy feet adoring fall</lines>
