    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>To Jesus ev'ry day<br/>I find my heart is closer drawn<br/>He's fairer than the glory of<br/>The gold and purple dawn<br/>He's all my fancy pictures in its<br/>Fairest dreams and more<br/>Each day he grows still sweeter<br/>Than He was the day before</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>The half cannot be fancied<br/>(The half cannot be fancied on<br/>This side the golden shore)<br/>This side the goldern shore<br/>(The half cannot be fancied on<br/>This side the golden shore)<br/>Oh there He'll be still sweeter<br/>(Oh there He'll be still sweeter<br/>Than He ever was before)<br/>Than He ever was before<br/>(than He ever was before)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His glory broke upon me<br/>When I saw Him from afar<br/>He's fairer than the lily<br/>Brighter than the morning star<br/>He fills and satisfies my longing<br/>Spirit o'er and o'er<br/>Each day he grows still sweeter<br/>Than he was the day before</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>My heart is sometimes heavy<br/>But He comes with sweet relief<br/>He folds me to His bosom<br/>When I droop with blighting grief<br/>I love the Christ who all<br/>My burdens in His body bore<br/>Each day He grows still sweeter<br/>Than He was the day before</lines>
