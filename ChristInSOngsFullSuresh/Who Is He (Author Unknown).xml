    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>D<br/><br/>Who is He - Who's the mightiest of all<br/>Who is He - Creation trembles at His call<br/>Who is He - The lowly sacrifice<br/>Who paid a victim's price<br/>His name is Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Jesus - from the Father's own right hand<br/>Jesus - Son of God and Son of Man<br/>Jesus - who died and rose again<br/>Jesus - He's the lion and the lamb</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who is He - With the power none can tame<br/>Who is He - When every foe would fear His name<br/>Who is He - Who was humbly led away<br/>To suffer that dark day<br/>His name is Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who is He - With eyes that burn like fire<br/>Who is He - Oh the wonder He inspires<br/>Who is He - He bore the guilt and shame<br/>For the ones who'd gone astray<br/>His name is Jesus</lines>
