    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>D<br/><br/>God in heaven hath a treasure<br/>Riches none may count or tell<br/>Hath a deep eternal pleasure<br/>Christ the Son he loveth well<br/>God hath here on earth a treasure<br/>None but He its price may know<br/>Deep unfathomable pleasure<br/>Christ revealed in saints below</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Christ the Light that fills the heavens<br/>Shining forth on earth beneath<br/>Through His Spirit freely given<br/>Light of life 'midst shades of death<br/>Down from heaven's unclouded glory<br/>God Himself the treasure brought<br/>Closing thus His love's sweet story<br/>With His sweetest deepest thought</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>God in tongues of fire descending<br/>Chosen vessels thus to fill<br/>With the treasure never ending<br/>Ever spent unfailing still<br/>Still unwasted undiminished<br/>Though the days of dearth wear on<br/>Store eternally unfinished<br/>Fresh as if but now begun</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Earthen vessels marred unsightly<br/>But the treasure as of old<br/>Fresh from glory gleaming brightly<br/>Heaven's undimmed unchanging gold<br/>Gods own hand the vessel filling<br/>From the glory far above<br/>Longing hearts forever stilling<br/>With those riches of His love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Thus through earthen vessels only<br/>Shinning forth in ceaseless grace<br/>Reaching weary hearts and lonely<br/>Beams the light in Jesus' face<br/>Vessels worthless broken bearing<br/>Through the hungry ages on<br/>Riches given with hand unsparing<br/>God's great gift - His precious Son</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Thus though worn and tried and tempted<br/>Glorious calling saint is thine<br/>Let the Lord but find thee emptied<br/>Living branch in Christ the vine<br/>Vessels of the world's despising<br/>Vessels weak and poor and base<br/>Bearing wealth God's heart is prizing<br/>Glory from Christ's blessed face</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Oh to be but emptier lowlier<br/>Mean unnoticed and unknown<br/>And to God a vessel holier<br/>Filled with Christ and Christ alone<br/>Naught of earth to cloud the glory<br/>Naught of self the light to dim<br/>Telling forth His wondrous story<br/>Emptied to be filled with Him</lines>
    </verse>
