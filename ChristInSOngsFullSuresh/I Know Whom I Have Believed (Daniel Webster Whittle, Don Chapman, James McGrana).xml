    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>C<br/>I know not why God's wondrous grace<br/>To me He hath made known<br/>Nor why unworthy Christ in love<br/>Redeemed me for His own</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>But I know Whom I have believed<br/>And am persuaded that He is able<br/>To keep that which I've committed<br/>Unto Him against that day</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I know not how this saving faith<br/>To me He did impart<br/>Nor how believing in His Word<br/>Wrought peace within my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I know not how the Spirit moves<br/>Convincing us of sin<br/>Revealing Jesus through the Word<br/>Creating faith in Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I know not what of good or ill<br/>May be reserved for me<br/>Of weary ways or golden days<br/>Before His face I see</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I know not when my Lord may come<br/>At night or noonday fair<br/>Nor if I walk the vale with Him<br/>Or meet Him in the air</lines>
    </verse>
