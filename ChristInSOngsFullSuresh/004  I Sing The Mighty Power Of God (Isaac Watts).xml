    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I sing the mighty power of God<br/>That made the mountains rise<br/>That spread the flowing seas abroad<br/>And built the lofty skies<br/>I sing the wisdom that ordained<br/>The sun to rule the day<br/>The moon shines full at His command<br/>And all the stars obey</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I sing the goodness of the Lord<br/>That filled the earth with food<br/>He formed the creatures with His word<br/>And then pronounced them good<br/>Lord how Thy wonders are displayed<br/>Where'er I turn my eye<br/>If I survey the ground I tread<br/>Or gaze upon the sky</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's not a plant or flower below<br/>But makes Thy glories known<br/>And clouds arise and tempests blow<br/>By order from Thy throne<br/>God's hand is my perpetual guard<br/>He guides me with His eye<br/>Why should I then forget the Lord<br/>Whose love is ever nigh</lines>
