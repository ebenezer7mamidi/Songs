    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>F (tune of Here is Love)<br/>There's a wideness in God's mercy<br/>Like the wideness of the sea<br/>there's a kindness in His justice<br/>Which is more than liberty</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There is welcome for the sinner<br/>And more graces for the good<br/>There is mercy with the Savior<br/>There is healing in His blood</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There is plentiful redemption<br/>In the blood that has been shed<br/>There is joy for all the members<br/>In the sorrows of the Head</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For the love of God is broader<br/>Than the measure of man's mind<br/>And the heart of the Eternal<br/>Is most wonderfully kind</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>If our love were but more simple<br/>We should take Him at His word<br/>And our lives would be all sunshine<br/>In the sweetness of our Lord</lines>
    </verse>
