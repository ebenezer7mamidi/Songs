    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have learned the wondrous secret<br/>Of abiding in the Lord<br/>I have tasted life's pure fountain<br/>I am drinking of His word<br/>I have found the strength and sweetness<br/>Of abiding 'neath the blood<br/>I have lost myself in Jesus<br/>I am sinking into God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I'm abiding in the Lord<br/>And confiding in His word<br/>I am hiding in the bosom of His love<br/>Yes abiding in the Lord<br/>And confiding in His word<br/>I am hiding in the bosom of His love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I am crucified with Jesus<br/>And He lives and dwells with me<br/>I have ceased from all my struggling<br/>'Tis no longer I but He<br/>All my will is yielding to Him<br/>And His Spirit reigns within<br/>And His precious blood each moment<br/>Keeps me cleansed and free from sin</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>All my sicknesses I bring Him<br/>And He bears them all away<br/>All my fears and griefs I tell Him<br/>All my cares from day to day<br/>All my strength I draw from Jesus<br/>By His breath I live and move<br/>E'en His very mind He gives me<br/>And His faith and life and love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For my words I take His wisdom<br/>For my works His Spirit's power<br/>For my ways His ceaseless presence<br/>Guards and guides me every hour<br/>Of my heart He is the portion<br/>Of my joy the boundless spring<br/>Savior Sanctifier Healer<br/>Glorious Lord and coming King</lines>
