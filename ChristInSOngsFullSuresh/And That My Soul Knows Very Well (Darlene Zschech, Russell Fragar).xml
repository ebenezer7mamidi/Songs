    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>When mountains fall I'll stand<br/>By the power of Your hand<br/>And in Your heart of hearts I'll dwell<br/>And that my soul knows very well</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You make Your face to shine on me<br/>And that my soul knows very well<br/>You lift me up I'm cleansed and free<br/>And that my soul knows very well</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Joy and strength each day I'll find<br/>And that my soul knows very well<br/>Forgiveness hope I know is mine<br/>And that my soul knows very well</lines>
