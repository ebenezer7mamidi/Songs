    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>oh endless theme of never ceasing song<br/>and music wakened by supremest love<br/>how hath it broke from feeble lips and strong<br/>the pow'r divine and matchless grace to prove</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>christ Son of God<br/>and christ in Kingly Reign<br/>so through the ages<br/>since the song began<br/>with swelling hosts<br/>the saints repeat the strain<br/>with swelling hosts<br/>the saints repeat the strain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>oh hills and plains<br/>the Israelite only knew<br/>on classic soil<br/>on drifting desert sand<br/>where'er the Roman eagles swiftly flew<br/>or roamed ahead<br/>the fierce ungoverned band</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>'Mong Jew and Gentile as in wondering horde<br/>barbarian Scythian all the bond or free<br/>there were who watched and waited for the lord<br/>and some who did His mighty wonders see</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>how from the warm and ever-ruddy East<br/>far to the rugged North and golden West<br/>the knowledge of this wondrous christ increased<br/>with life and hope the dying nations blessed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>thence saints exultant onward bore His sign<br/>from land to land<br/>and compassed every shore<br/>one lord one faith<br/>one aim one end divine<br/>their theme and song<br/>their life for evermore</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4a">
      <lines>since holy women bowed their heads and wept<br/>where from the grave the angel rolled the stone<br/>that grave where He the Son of God had slept</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4b">
      <lines>as Son of Man in darkness and alone<br/>what countless names<br/>the world's applause have won<br/>what notes of praise<br/>have men to these inscribed<br/>how soon were they forgotten one by one<br/>and earth's poor honors to the dead denied</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5a">
      <lines>not mightiest kings<br/>the earth has ever seen<br/>nor time nor powers<br/>men honored or abhorred<br/>could crush the memory of the Nazarene<br/>or shut the saints<br/>from the presence of their lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5b">
      <lines>in kingly courts<br/>in prisons foul and damp<br/>in scenes tumultuous<br/>as in homes of peace<br/>there with His own<br/>god's Angel would encamp<br/>there rise the songs<br/>that nevermore shall cease</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6a">
      <lines>thus through the years<br/>of ages long ago<br/>thus in the changes<br/>of these latter days<br/>one only lord<br/>our lord above below<br/>and He the object of our endless praise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6b">
      <lines>this the same key-note of unnumbered lyres<br/>this too th' unending song of sweet accord<br/>o world ye have no theme<br/>that thus inspires<br/>ye still reject and crucify the lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7a">
      <lines>in furnace-fires<br/>on mountains drear and cold<br/>in peasant hut<br/>as in the palace-hall<br/>the story of His life forever told<br/>and His dear love<br/>the burning theme of all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7b">
      <lines>from lips too weak<br/>aught human to express<br/>from noble hearts<br/>that held the world at bay<br/>what songs have risen<br/>and what strains confess<br/>the blessed One<br/>whom i would praise today</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8a">
      <lines>christ Son of god<br/>and christ the Son of Man<br/>christ on the Cross<br/>and christ in Kingly Reign<br/>so sang the saints<br/>when first the song began<br/>so shall it rise<br/>a never-ending strain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8b">
      <lines>come thou and touch my lips<br/>that i may sing<br/>come fill my heart with love<br/>to overflow<br/>my lord my Life<br/>i would some tribute bring<br/>and tell the world how much<br/>to Thee i owe</lines>
