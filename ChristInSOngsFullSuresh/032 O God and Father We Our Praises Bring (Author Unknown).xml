      <lines>D<br/><br/>O God and Father we Our praises bring<br/>For who more worthy of Our praise could be<br/>Than Thou who seekest Worshipers who sing<br/>In spirit and in truth adoringly</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All worlds Thou hast Created by the Son<br/>All things are held by His Unmeasured power<br/>Yet we approach Thee In that glorious One<br/>What cause for worship In this holy hour</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>'Tis He who leads us in This blessed sphere<br/>In the assembly singing Praise to Thee<br/>What joy to Him that we Should thus be near<br/>As suited and in perfect liberty</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Here we unite our Song of joy is one<br/>And Thou O God art fully satisfied<br/>Amidst the praises led By Christ Thy Son<br/>Thou hast a dwelling ever to abide</lines>
