    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My heart is fixed eternal God<br/>Fixed on Thee - fixed on Thee<br/>And my immortal choice is made<br/>Christ for me - Christ for me<br/>He is my Prophet Priest and King<br/>Who did for me salvation bring<br/>And while I've breath I mean to sing<br/>Christ for me<br/>Christ for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In Him I see the Godhead shine<br/>Christ for me - Christ for me<br/>He is the majesty divine<br/>Christ for me - Christ for me<br/>The Father's well-beloved Son<br/>Co-partner of His royal throne<br/>Who bore the guilt of man alone<br/>Christ for me<br/>Christ for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Let others boast of heaps of gold<br/>Christ for me - Christ for me<br/>His riches never can be told<br/>Christ for me - Christ for me<br/>Your gold will waste and wear away<br/>Your honors perish in a day<br/>My portion never can decay<br/>Christ for me<br/>Christ for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>In pining sickness or in health<br/>Christ for me - Christ for me<br/>In deepest poverty or wealth<br/>Christ for me - Christ for me<br/>And in that all-important day<br/>When I the summons must obey<br/>And pass from this dark world away<br/>Christ for me<br/>Christ for me</lines>
