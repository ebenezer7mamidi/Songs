    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>1. I hear the words of love,<br/> I gaze upon the blood,<br/> I see the mighty sacrifice,<br/> And I have peace with God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>2. 'Tis everlasting peace!<br/> Sure as Jehovah's Name,<br/> 'Tis stable as His steadfast throne,<br/> For evermore the same.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>3. The clouds may go and come,<br/> And storms may sweep my sky;<br/> This blood-sealed friendship changes not,<br/> The Cross is ever nigh.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>4. My love is ofttimes low,<br/> My joy still ebbs and flows,<br/> But peace with Him remains the same,<br/> No change my Savior knows.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>5. I change, He changes not:<br/> The Christ can never die,<br/> His love, not mine, the resting-place,<br/> His truth, not mine, the tie.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>6. The Cross still stands unchanged,<br/> Though heaven is now His home;<br/> The mighty stone is rolled away,<br/> But yonder is His tomb!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>7. And yonder is my peace,<br/> The grave of all my woes!<br/> I know the Son of God has come,<br/> I know He died and rose.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>8. I know He liveth now<br/> At God's right hand above;<br/> I know the throne on which He sits,<br/> I know His truth and love!<br/> by Horatius Bonar</lines>
