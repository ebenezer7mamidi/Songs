      <lines>Jesus Himself drew near<br/>And joined them as they walked<br/>And soon their hearts<br/>Began to burn<br/>As of Himself He talked<br/>Draw near O Lord<br/>Draw near O Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus Himself drew near<br/>They were no longer sad<br/>When He was walking<br/>At their side<br/>How could they but be glad<br/>Draw near O Lord<br/>Draw near O Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus Himself drew near<br/>And all their doubts were solved<br/>He showed them why<br/>Christ came to die<br/>And what that death involved<br/>Draw near O Lord<br/>Draw near O Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Jesus Himself drew near<br/>And at the journey's end<br/>They could not let Him<br/>Leave them thus<br/>The Stranger was their friend<br/>Draw near O Lord<br/>Draw near O Lord</lines>
