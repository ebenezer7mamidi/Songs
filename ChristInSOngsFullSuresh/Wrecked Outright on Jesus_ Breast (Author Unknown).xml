    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>1. "Wrecked outright on Jesus' breast":<br/> Only "wrecked" souls thus can sing;<br/> Little boats that hug the shore,<br/> Fearing what the storm may bring,<br/> Never find on Jesus' breast,<br/> All that "wrecked" souls mean by rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>2. "Wrecked outright!" So we lament;<br/> But when storms have<br/> Done their worst,<br/> Then the soul, surviving all,<br/> In Eternal arms is nursed;<br/> There to find that nought can move<br/> One, embosomed in such love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>3. "Wrecked outright!" No more to own<br/> E'en a craft to sail the sea;<br/> Still a voyager, yet now<br/> Anchored to Infinity;<br/> Nothing left to do but fling<br/> Care aside, and simply cling.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>4. "Wrecked outright!"<br/> 'Twas purest gain,<br/> Henceforth other craft can see<br/> That the storm may be a boon,<br/> That, however rough the sea,<br/> God Himself doth watchful stand,<br/> For the "wreck" is in His hand.</lines>
