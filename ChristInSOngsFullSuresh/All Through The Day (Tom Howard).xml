    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>D<br/>All through the day<br/>All through the night<br/>Dwell in His promises<br/>Walk in His light<br/>Darkness will flee<br/>At His command<br/>All through the day and night<br/>We're in His hand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You have a friend<br/>He waits for you<br/>Watching to see<br/>Just what you'll do<br/>You'll only find your strength<br/>Within His mighty calm<br/>And with His joy<br/>Your life will be a Psalm</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Tell Him your cares<br/>Confess your doubts<br/>He works within<br/>To work it out<br/>His Word will comfort you<br/>His love is a healing balm<br/>And with His joy<br/>Your life will be a Psalm</lines>
