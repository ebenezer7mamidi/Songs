      <lines>Feed on His faithfulness my soul<br/>Who chose thee for His own<br/>Who bears thy name in Love's pure flame<br/>Before the heav'nly throne<br/>Lay at His feet thy fear<br/>Thy burdens thy distress<br/>Prostrate embrace thy Fount of Grace<br/>Feed on His faithfulness</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Feed on His faithfulness my soul<br/>Who suffered Calvary<br/>Who Victor rose o'er all thy foes<br/>Who lives who prays for thee<br/>Not thine the battle is<br/>Though close the conflict press<br/>'Tis His alone who wears the crown<br/>Feed on His faithfulness</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Feed on His faithfulness my soul<br/>Then naught shall thee affright<br/>His perfect will all fear shall still<br/>His wisdom guide aright<br/>He slumbers not nor sleeps<br/>But waits His saints to bless<br/>Th'eternal Throne is His alone<br/>Feed on His faithfulness</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Feed on His faithfulness my soul<br/>So shalt thou see His face<br/>Transforming thee till all shall see<br/>The glory of His grace<br/>Closer to His great heart<br/>In glad abandon press<br/>Fling thy soul down upon His own<br/>Feed on His faithfulness</lines>
