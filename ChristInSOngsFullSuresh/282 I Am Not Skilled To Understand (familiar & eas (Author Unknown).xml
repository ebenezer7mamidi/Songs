    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I am not skilled to understand<br/>what God hath will'd what God hath plann'd<br/>I only know at His right hand<br/>stands one who is my Savior</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I take Him at His word indeed<br/>"Christ died for sinners," this I read<br/>and in my heart I find a need<br/>for Him to be my Savior</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And was there then no other way<br/>For god to take? I cannot say<br/>I only bless Him day by day<br/>Who saved me through my Savior</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>That He should leave His place on high<br/>and come for sinful men to die<br/>You count it strange? So once did I<br/>Before I knew my Savior</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>And oh, that He fulfilled may see<br/>The travail of His soul in me<br/>And with His work contented be<br/>As I with my dear Savior</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Yes living, dying, let me bring<br/>My strength, my solace from this spring<br/>That He who lives to be my King<br/>Once died to be my Savior.</lines>
