    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Of Jesus' love that sought me<br/>When I was lost in sin<br/>Of wondrous grace that brought me<br/>Back to His fold again<br/>Of heights and depths of mercy<br/>Far deeper than the sea<br/>And higher than the heavens<br/>My theme shall ever be</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Sweeter as the years go by<br/>Sweeter as the years go by<br/> (Sisters: as the years go by)<br/>Richer fuller deeper<br/>Jesus' love is sweeter<br/>Sweeter as the years go by</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He trod in old Judea<br/>Life's pathway long ago<br/>The people thronged about Him<br/>His saving grace to know<br/>He healed the broken-hearted<br/>And caused the blind to see<br/>And still His great heart yearneth<br/>In love for even me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>'Twas wondrous love which led Him<br/>For us to suffer loss<br/>To bear without a murmur<br/>The anguish of the cross<br/>With saints redeemed in glory<br/>Let us our voices raise<br/>Till heav'n and earth re-echo<br/>With our Redeemer's praise</lines>
