    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My home is God Himself<br/>Christ brought me there<br/>And bade me dwell in<br/>Him rejoicing there<br/>He bore me where no foot<br/>But His hath trod<br/>Within the holiest at home with God<br/>O holy place - O home divinely fair<br/>And we God's little<br/>Ones abiding there</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>A long long road I traveled<br/>Night and day<br/>And sought to find within myself<br/>Some way<br/>Aught I could do or feel<br/>To bring me near<br/>Self effort failed and I was<br/>Filled with fear<br/>And then I found Christ<br/>Was the only way<br/>That I must come to Him<br/>And in Him stay</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O wondrous place - O home divinely fair<br/>And I God's little one safe hidden there<br/>Lord as I dwell in Thee and Thou in me<br/>So make me dead to<br/>Everything but Thee<br/>That as I rest within my home most fair<br/>I'll share my God in all and everywhere</lines>
