    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>the cross<br/>it takes our guilt away<br/>it holds the fainting spirit up<br/>it cheers with hope the gloomy day<br/>and sweetens every bitter cup</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>it makes the coward spirit brave<br/>and nerves the feeble arm for fight<br/>it takes its terror from the grave<br/>and gilds the bed of death with light</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>the balm of life<br/>the curse of woe<br/>the measure<br/>and the pledge of love<br/>the sinner's refuge here below<br/>the theme of praise in heav'n above</lines>
