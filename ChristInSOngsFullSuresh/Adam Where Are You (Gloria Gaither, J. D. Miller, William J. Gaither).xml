    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Adam where are you<br/>I came to walk with you<br/>And found an empty place<br/>Where face to face<br/>We used to talk<br/>Adam I love you<br/>And I will find a way<br/>Wo bring you back someday<br/>To where we first began<br/>Adam where are you<br/>Adam where are you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I gave you sight and breath<br/>The choice of life or death<br/>And put within your heart<br/>The yearning to belong<br/>But all along I knew<br/>The choice was up to you<br/>To give me all your heart<br/>Or lose your song</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I came when ev'ning fell<br/>To where we knew so well<br/>To hear your laughter echo down<br/>The well worn lane<br/>But there was no one there<br/>Just silence ev'rywhere<br/>The forests seemed to sense<br/>A Father's pain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>Adam where are you<br/>Adam where are you<br/>Adam where are you<br/>My child where are you</lines>
