    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>C<br/><br/>Your only Son no sin to hide<br/>But You have sent Him from Your side<br/>To walk upon this guilty sod<br/>And to become the Lamb of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Oh Lamb of God sweet Lamb of God<br/>I love the holy Lamb of God<br/>Oh wash me in His precious blood<br/>My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Your gift of love they crucified<br/>They laughed and scorned Him as He died<br/>The humble King they named a fraud<br/>And sacrificed the Lamb of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I was so lost I should have died<br/>But You have brought me to Your side<br/>To be led by Your staff and rod<br/>And to be called a lamb of God</lines>
