    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Church has waited long<br/>Her absent Lord to see<br/>And still in lonelinness she waits<br/>A friendless stranger she<br/>Age after age has gone<br/>Sun after sun has set<br/>And still in robes of widowhood<br/>She weeps a mourner yet</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Saint after saint on earth<br/>Has lived and loved and died<br/>And as they left us one by one<br/>We laid them side by side<br/>We laid them down to sleep<br/>But not in hope forlorn<br/>We laid them but to ripen more<br/>Come then Lord Jesus - come</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Serpent's brood increase<br/>The powers of hell grow bold<br/>The conflict thickens faith is low<br/>And love is waxing cold<br/>How long O Lord our God<br/>Holy and true and good<br/>Wilt thou not judge The suffering Church<br/>Her sighs and tears and blood</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We long to hear thy voice<br/>To see Thee face to face<br/>To share Thy crown and glory then<br/>As now we share Thy grace<br/>Should not the loving bride<br/>Her absent bridegroom mourn<br/>Should she not wear the signs of grief<br/>Until her Lord return</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>The whole creation groans<br/>And waits to hear that voice<br/>That shall restore her comeliness<br/>And make her wastes rejoice<br/>Come Lord and wipe away<br/>The curse the sin the stain<br/>And make this blighted world of ours<br/>Thine own fair world again</lines>
    </verse>
