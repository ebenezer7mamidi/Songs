    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Adam fell and we fell in him ages ago<br/>Death and sin had entered in the world, and so<br/>God sent down His Son for us;<br/>Victory He won for us.<br/>Hallelujah. (repeat 3x)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>God looked down upon the world and evil He saw;<br/>Through the sons of Israel He gave us the Law<br/>But the standard was too high for us<br/>So Jesus came and died for us.<br/>Hallelujah. (repeat 3x)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Some day Jesus will return to take us all home;<br/>We will be content to praise Him all the day long<br/>"Worthy is the Lamb!" we'll sing<br/>Praising Jesus Christ our King.<br/>Hallelujah. (repeat 3x)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So until that glorious day we're here amongst men<br/>Holding Jesus' testimony until He comes again,<br/>Deep in Christ abiding,<br/>In His life we're hiding.<br/>Hallelujah.</lines>
    </verse>
