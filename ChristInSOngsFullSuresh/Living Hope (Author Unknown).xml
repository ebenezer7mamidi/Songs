    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>A<br/><br/>How great the chasm that lay between us<br/>How high the mountain I could not climb<br/>In desperation, I turned to heaven<br/>And spoke Your name into the night</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>Then through the darkness, Your loving-kindness<br/>Tore through the shadows of my soul<br/>The work is finished, the end is written<br/>Jesus Christ, my living hope</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free<br/>Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me<br/>You have broken every chain<br/>There's salvation in Your name<br/>Jesus Christ, my living hope</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>Who could imagine so great a mercy?<br/>What heart could fathom such boundless grace?<br/>The God of ages stepped down from glory<br/>To wear my sin and bear my shame</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>The cross has spoken, I am forgiven<br/>The King of kings calls me His own<br/>Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever<br/>Jesus Christ, my living hope</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Then came the morning that sealed the promise<br/>Your buried body began to breathe<br/>Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion<br/>Declared the grave has no claim on me<br/>Jesus, Yours is the victory</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free<br/>Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me<br/>You have broken every chain<br/>There's salvation in Your name<br/>Jesus Christ, my living hope<br/>(repeat)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>Jesus Christ, my living hope<br/>Oh God, You are my living hope</lines>
