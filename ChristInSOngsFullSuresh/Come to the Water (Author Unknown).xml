    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh let all who thirst<br/>let them come to the water<br/>And let all who have nothing<br/>let them come to the Lord<br/>Without money, without price<br/>Why should you pay the price<br/>except for the Lord, for the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And let all who seek<br/>Let them come to the water<br/>And let all who have nothing<br/>Let them come to the Lord<br/>Without money, without strife<br/>Why should you spend your life<br/>Except for the Lord, for the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And let all who toil<br/>Let them come to the water<br/>And let all who are weary<br/>Let them come to the Lord<br/>All who labor, without rest<br/>How can your soul find rest<br/>Except for the Lord, for the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And let all the poor<br/>Let them come to the water<br/>Bring the ones who are laden<br/>Bring them all to the Lord<br/>Bring the children without might<br/>Easy the load and light<br/>Come to the Lord, to the Lord</lines>
