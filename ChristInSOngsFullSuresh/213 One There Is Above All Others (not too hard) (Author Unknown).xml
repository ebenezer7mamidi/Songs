    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>One there is above all others<br/>Well deserves the name of Friend<br/>His is love beyond a brother's<br/>Costly free and knows no end<br/>They who once His kindness prove<br/>Find it everlasting love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Which of all our friends to save us<br/>Could or would have shed their blood<br/>But our Jesus died to have us<br/>Reconciled in Him to God<br/>This was boundless love indeed<br/>Jesus is a Friend in need</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Men when raised to lofty stations<br/>Often know their friends no more<br/>Slight and scorn their poor relations<br/>Though they valued them before<br/>But our Savior always owns<br/>Those whom He redeemed with groans</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When He lived on earth abased<br/>Friend of sinners was His name<br/>Now above all glory raised<br/>He rejoices in the same<br/>Still He calls them brethren friends<br/>And to all their wants attends</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Could we bear from one another<br/>What He daily bears from us<br/>Yet this glorious Friend and Brother<br/>Loves us though we treat Him thus<br/>Though for good we render ill<br/>He accounts us brethren still</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Oh for grace our hearts to soften<br/>Teach us Lord at length to love<br/>We alas forget too often<br/>What a Friend we have above<br/>But when home our souls are brought<br/>We will love Thee as we ought</lines>
    </verse>
