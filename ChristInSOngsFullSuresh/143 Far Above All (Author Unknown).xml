    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>E<br/><br/>Far above all is our Savior enthroned<br/>Crowned is the Lamb who for sinners atoned<br/>Living forever to list to our call<br/>God hath exalted Him far above all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Far above all - Far above all<br/>Jesus the crucified - Far above all<br/>Low at his footstool<br/>Adoring we fall<br/>God hath exalted Him<br/>Far above all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When the fierce tempest uplifting its waves<br/>Seeks to engulf us we cry and He saves<br/>Looking to Jesus upheld by His hand<br/>Tread we the billows as safe as on Land</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>High are the cities that dare our assault<br/>Strong are the barriers that call us to halt<br/>March we on fearless<br/>And down they must fall<br/>Vanquished by faith in Him far above all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>His is the Kingdom from pole unto pole<br/>Far above all while the ages shall roll<br/>With Him the victors who followed His call<br/>Share in His royalty far above all</lines>
    </verse>
