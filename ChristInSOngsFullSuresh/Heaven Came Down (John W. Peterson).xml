    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O what a wonderful wonderful day<br/>Day I will never forget<br/>After I'd wandered in darkness away<br/>Jesus my Savior I met<br/>O what a tender compassionate friend<br/>He met the need of my heart<br/>Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling<br/>He made all the darkness depart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Heaven came down and glory filled my soul<br/> echo - my soul<br/>When at the cross the Savior made me whole<br/> echo - me whole<br/>My sins were washed away<br/>And my night was turned to day<br/>Heaven came down and glory filled my soul</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Born of the Spirit with life from above<br/>Into God's fam'ly divine<br/>Justified fully thru Calvary's love<br/>O what a standing is mine<br/>And the transaction so quickly was made<br/>When as a sinner I came<br/>Took of the offer of grace<br/>He did proffer He saved me<br/>O praise His dear name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Now I've a hope that will surely endure<br/>After the passing of time<br/>I have a future in heaven for sure<br/>There in those mansions sublime<br/>And it's because of that wonderful day<br/>When at the cross I believed<br/>Riches eternal and blessings supernal<br/>From His precious hand I received</lines>
    </verse>
