      <lines>Glory to Christ on high!<br/>Let heav'n and earth reply,<br/>"Praise ye His name!"<br/>His love and grace adore,<br/>Who all our sorrows bore;<br/>Sing loud forevermore,<br/>"Worthy the Lamb!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>While they around the throne<br/>Cheerfully join in one,<br/>Praising His name -<br/>Ye who have felt His blood<br/>Sealing your peace with God,<br/>Sound His dear name abroad,<br/>"Worthy the Lamb!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Join, all ye ransomed race,<br/>Our Lord and God to bless;<br/>Praise ye His name!<br/>In Him we will rejoice,<br/>And make a joyful noise,<br/>Shouting with heart and voice,<br/>"Worthy the Lamb!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>What though we change our place,<br/>Yet we shall never cease<br/>Praising His name;<br/>To Him our songs we bring,<br/>Hail Him our gracious King,<br/>And without ceasing sing,<br/>"Worthy the Lamb!"</lines>
