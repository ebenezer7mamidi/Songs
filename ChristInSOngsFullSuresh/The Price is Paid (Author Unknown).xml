    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>C<br/>The price is paid,<br/>Come let us enter in<br/>To all that Jesus died<br/>To make our own,<br/>For every sin<br/>More than enough He gave,<br/>And bought our freedom<br/>From each guilty stain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>The price is paid, Alleluia,<br/>Amazing grace,<br/>So strong and sure;<br/>And so with all my heart,<br/>My life in every part,<br/>I live to thank You for The price You paid.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The price is paid,<br/>See Satan flee away;<br/>For Jesus crucified<br/>Destroys his power.<br/>No more to pay,<br/>Let accusation cease,<br/>In Christ there is no<br/>Condemnation now.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The price is paid,<br/>And by that scourging cruel<br/>He took our sinfulness<br/>As if His own.<br/>And by His wounds<br/>His body broken there,<br/>His healing touch may now<br/>By faith be known.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The price is paid,<br/>"Worthy The Lamb," we cry,<br/>Eternity shall never<br/>Cease to praise.<br/>The Church of Christ<br/>Shall rule upon the earth,<br/>In Jesus' name<br/>We have authority.</lines>
