    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've tried in vain a thousand ways<br/>My fears to quell my hopes to raise<br/>But what I need the Bible says<br/>Is ever only Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>My soul is night my heart is steel<br/>I cannot see I cannot feel<br/>For light for life I must appeal<br/>In simple faith to Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He died - He lives - He reigns - He pleads<br/>There's love in all His words and deeds<br/>There's all a guilty sinner needs<br/>Forevermore in Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Though some should sneer<br/>And some should blame<br/>I'll go with all my guilt and shame<br/>I'll go to Him because His name<br/>Above all names is Jesus</lines>
