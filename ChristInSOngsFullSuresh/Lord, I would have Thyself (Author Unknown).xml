    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord, I would have Thyself in all Thy beauty,<br/>Take Thou control of all my life just now;<br/>In Thee to live, and move, and have my being,<br/>With full abandon, Lord, to Thee I bow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Thy blood was shed to cleanse from sin, Lord Jesus,<br/>Thy risen Life transforms the old to new;<br/>I take my stand upon Thy word of promise:<br/>Sin shall not have dominion over you!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Show me the things of which I am unconscious,<br/>Lord, put Thy finger now upon my heart;<br/>Whisper to me, through Thy blest Holy Spirit,<br/>Tell me what grieves Him, that it may depart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thou art my victor over keen temptation, <br/>Thou art my Shield, to meet the darts of sin;<br/>Lord Jesus, Thou alone can keep me trusting,<br/>And living out Thy glorious Life within.</lines>
