    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He brought them forth<br/>With silver and gold<br/>And there were not<br/>many feeble among their tribe</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He gave a cloud for covering<br/>And fire by the night<br/>He opened up the rock<br/>And the waters gushed forth<br/>Like a river in dry places</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And he brought forth his people with joy<br/>And he brought forth his people with joy<br/>He brought them forth with gladness<br/>He brought forth his people with joy</lines>
