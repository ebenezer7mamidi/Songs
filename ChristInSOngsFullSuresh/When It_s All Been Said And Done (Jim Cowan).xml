    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When it's all been said and done<br/>There is just one thing that matters<br/>Did I do my best to live for truth<br/>Did I live my life for You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When it's all been said and done<br/>All my treasures will mean nothing<br/>Only what I've done for love's reward<br/>Will stand the test of time</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord Your mercy is so great<br/>That You look beyond our weakness<br/>And find purest gold in miry clay<br/>Making sinners into saints</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I will always sing Your praise<br/>Here on earth and ever after<br/>For You've shown me Heaven's my true home<br/>When it's all been said and done<br/>You're my life when life is gone</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>Lord I'll live my life for You</lines>
