    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My goal is God Himself not joy nor peace<br/>Nor even blessing but Himself my God<br/>Tis His to lead me there - nor mine - but His<br/>At any cost dear Lord by any road</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So faith bounds forward to its goal in God<br/>And love can trust her Lord to lead her there<br/>Upheld by Him my soul is following hard<br/>Till God hath full fulfilled my deepest prayer</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>No matter if the way be sometimes dark<br/>No matter if the cost be oft-times great<br/>He knoweth how I best shall reach the mark<br/>The way that leads to Him must needs be straight</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>One thing I know I cannot say Him nay<br/>One thing I do I press towards my Lord<br/>My God my glory here, from day to day<br/>And in the glory there my great reward</lines>
    </verse>
