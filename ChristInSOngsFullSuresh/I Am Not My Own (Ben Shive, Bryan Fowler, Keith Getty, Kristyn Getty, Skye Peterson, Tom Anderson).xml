  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The One who made the heavens, made my heart and soul<br/>Before I drew a breath, I was loved and known<br/>I am His creation, the Maker's masterpiece<br/>And all that He designs will be done in me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>My body is a temple of the living God<br/>I'll worship in this house that His blood has bought<br/>As I bear His image, oh, may I not profane<br/>The holiness I hold in this earthly frame</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I belong to the Lord, oh, I am not my own<br/>I belong to the Lord, I am not my own<br/>I will honor Him for this I know<br/>I belong to the Lord, I am not my own</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And if He has redeemed me, I am not my own<br/>The measure of my worth is His love alone<br/>He declares my standing, and He declares my state<br/>So I will know myself by the name He gave</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I am not my own and now my heart is free<br/>O Maker, come and make what You will of me<br/>There is nothing broken that You cannot repair<br/>So Lord, I leave my life in Your loving care (I know that-)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>I will honor Him for this I know<br/>I belong to the Lord, I am not my own</lines>
    </verse>
