    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>E<br/><br/>You were despised,<br/>You were rejected,<br/>Lord those who passed by<br/>Even averted their gaze From the sight<br/>Such was the suffering You bore for us</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Led like a lamb,<br/>A lamb to the slaughter,<br/>You spoke not a word,<br/>But chose to be silent Though You did no wrong,<br/>Nor was deceitfulness Found in You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Yet by Your wounds our Salvation has come<br/>Yet by Your suffering Our freedom is won</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>For God has highly exalted Your name<br/>He has enthroned You on high<br/>Jesus the name above All names<br/>(2x)</lines>
