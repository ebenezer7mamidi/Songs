    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The cross that He gave may be heavy<br/>But it ne'er out weighs His grace<br/>The storm that I feared may surround me<br/>But it ne'er excludes His face</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>The cross is not greater than His grace<br/>The storm cannot hide His blessed face<br/>I am satisfied to know<br/>That with Jesus here below<br/>I can conquer ev'ry foe</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The thorns in my path are not sharper<br/>Than composed His crown for me<br/>The cup that I drink not more bitter<br/>Than He drank in Gethsemane</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The light of His love shineth brighter<br/>As it falls on paths of woe<br/>The toil of my work groweth lighter<br/>As I stoop to raise the low</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>His will I have joy in fulfilling<br/>As I'm walking in His sight<br/>My all to the blood I am bringing<br/>It alone can keep me right</lines>
    </verse>
