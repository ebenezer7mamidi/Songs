    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My song is love unknown<br/>My Savior's love to me<br/>Love to the love-less shown<br/>That they might lovely be<br/>O Who am I that for my sake<br/>My Lord should take frail flesh and die</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He came from His blest throne<br/>Salvation to bestow<br/>But men made strange and none<br/>The longed for Christ would know<br/>But oh my Friend my Friend indeed<br/>Who at my need His life did spend</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sometimes they strew His way<br/>And His sweet praises sing<br/>Resounding all the day<br/>Hosannas to their King<br/>Then 'Crucify' is all their breath<br/>And for His death they thirst and cry</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Why what hath my Lord done<br/>What makes this rage and spite<br/>He made the lame to run<br/>He gave the blind their sight<br/>Sweet injuries yet they at these<br/>Themselves they please<br/>And 'gainst Him rise</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>They rise and needs will have<br/>My dear Lord made away<br/>A murderer they save<br/>The Prince of Life they slay<br/>Yet cheerful He to suff'ring goes<br/>That he His foes from<br/>Thence might free</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>In life no house no home<br/>My Lord on earth might have<br/>In death no friendly tomb<br/>But what a stranger gave<br/>What may I say<br/>Heav'n was His home<br/>But mine the tomb<br/>wherein He lay</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Here might I stay and sing<br/>No story so divine<br/>Never was love dear King<br/>Never was grief like Thine<br/>This is my Friend<br/>In whose sweet praise<br/>I all my days<br/>Could gladly spend</lines>
    </verse>
