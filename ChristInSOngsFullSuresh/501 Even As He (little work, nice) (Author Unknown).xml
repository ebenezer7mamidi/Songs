    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>One in His death on the tree<br/>One as He rose from the dead<br/>I from the curse am as free<br/>E'en as my glorious Head<br/>One on the throne by His side<br/>One in His sonship divine<br/>One as the Bride-groom and bride<br/>One as the branch and the Vine</lines>

      <lines>One in His merits I stand<br/>One as I pray in His name<br/>All that His worth can command<br/>I can with confidence claim<br/>One in His faith and His love<br/>One in His life I may be<br/>Sealed by the heavenly Dove<br/>I may be holy as He</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>One in the rapturous hour<br/>When He shall come for His own<br/>Raised by His glorious power<br/>I shall sit down on His throne<br/>All that He has shall be mine<br/>All that He is I shall be<br/>Robed in His glory divine<br/>I shall be even as He</lines>
