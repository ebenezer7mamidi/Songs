    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The name of Jesus is our stand<br/>It is our victory<br/>Not on ourselves do we rely<br/>But mighty Lord on Thee<br/>Our weapons are not arms of flesh<br/>But ours the Spirit's Sword<br/>And God's whole armor putting on<br/>We battle in the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Behold the foe doth meet and plot<br/>Stand firm in one accord<br/>Tho war be fierce and darkness thick<br/>Resist him in the Lord<br/>If one through fear should backward turn<br/>He undermines the rest<br/>Oh do not let your brothers down<br/>Nor by you be distressed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The devil knows his time is short<br/>He is the more enraged<br/>And by his wiles would weaken us<br/>Before the battle's waged<br/>The trials now more numerous are<br/>The suff'ring e'en more sore<br/>The force of hell opposing us<br/>More dreadful than before</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>What should our posture be today<br/>In such a desperate hour<br/>Should we our ease and pleasure seek<br/>And let the foe devour<br/>Or with increasing conflict strong<br/>Courageous to endure<br/>'Tis here that life or death is won<br/>Who will God's praise secure</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>For Christ the Lord we then would stand<br/>He is the Conqueror<br/>For Him we would endure the pain<br/>Until the fight is o'er<br/>The hour of triumph soon we'll see<br/>The Lord will come again<br/>If now we suffer for His sake<br/>Then we with Him shall reign</lines>
    </verse>
