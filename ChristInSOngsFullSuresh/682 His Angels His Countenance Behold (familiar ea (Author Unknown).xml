    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>His angels His countenance always behold<br/>But never experience His grace<br/>His saints while they know His unlimited love<br/>Have never yet looked on His face<br/>Yet soon they will rise and His visage behold<br/>The sight of His glory will gain<br/>But Mary beholding His tear dimmed eyes<br/>Could see His heart's anguish and pain<br/>Could see His heart's anguish and pain</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We soon will see Jesus our Lord face to face<br/>We'll know him as never before<br/>But then there's no need for a hand such as His<br/>To heal a heart broken and sore<br/>In heaven we'll offer Him praise without end<br/>No praying or tears needed there<br/>Nor ever a burden to roll on our Friend<br/>Or place for importunate prayer<br/>Or place for importunate prayer</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In heavenly glory that day we'll be crowned<br/>And nevermore carry a cross<br/>'Tis only on earth where our Lord was disowned<br/>We share His rejection and loss<br/>When entering rest in that morning so fair<br/>Our anguish and trials will end<br/>His sorrow and shame we'll no more with Him share<br/>Or sacrifice pleasures for Him<br/>Or sacrifice pleasures for Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Alas we are left with few chances to share<br/>To learn and to taste of His grief<br/>Yet still for His sake His reproach we may bear<br/>Such times we can never retrieve<br/>Reviling and scorn shall we still here bemoan<br/>When soon they no longer will be<br/>I treasure these temporal blessings I've known<br/>For thus Lord I'm made one with Thee<br/>For thus Lord I'm made one with Thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I long Lord to gaze on Thy wonderful face<br/>'Tis better by far Thee to meet<br/>But now I would choose Thy dear suffering grace<br/>And not miss such fellowship sweet<br/>Have mercy on me - fill me Lord with Thy love<br/>To live for Thee here at all cost<br/>Lest earnestly seeking a heaven above<br/>I then regret chances were lost<br/>I then regret chances were lost</lines>
    </verse>
