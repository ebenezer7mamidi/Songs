    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Many crowd the Saviour's kingdom<br/>Few receive His cross<br/>Many seek His consolation<br/>Few will suffer loss<br/>For the dear sake of the Master<br/>Counting all by dross<br/>For the dear sake of the Master<br/>Counting all by dross</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Many sit at Jesus' table<br/>Few will fast with Him<br/>When the sorrow-cup of anguish<br/>Trembles at the brim<br/>Few watch with Him in the garden<br/>Who have sung the hymn<br/>Few watch with Him in the garden<br/>Who have sung the hymn</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Many will confess His wisdom<br/>Few embrace His shame<br/>Many, should He smile upon them<br/>Will His praise proclaim<br/>Then, if for a while He leave them<br/>They desert His name<br/>Then, if for a while He leave them<br/>They desert His name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>But the souls who love Him truly<br/>Let woe come or bliss<br/>These will count their dearest hearts' blood<br/>Not their own, but His<br/>Saviour, Thou who thus hast loved me<br/>Give me love like this<br/>Saviour, Thou who thus hast loved me<br/>Give me love like this</lines>
    </verse>
