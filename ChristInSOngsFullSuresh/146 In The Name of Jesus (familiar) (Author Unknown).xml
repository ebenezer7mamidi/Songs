    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the Name of Jesus<br/>Every knee shall bow<br/>Every tongue confess Him<br/>King of glory now<br/>'Tis the Father's pleasure<br/>We should call Him Lord<br/>Who from the begining<br/>Was the Mighty Word</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>At His voice creation<br/>Sprang at once to sight<br/>All the angel faces<br/>All the hosts of light<br/>Thrones and dominations<br/>Stars upon their way<br/>All the heav'nly orders<br/>In their great array</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Humbled for a season<br/>To receive a Name<br/>From the lips of sinners<br/>Unto whom He came<br/>Faithfully He bore it<br/>Spotless to the last<br/>Brought it back victorious<br/>When from death He passed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Bore it up triumphant<br/>With its human light<br/>Through all ranks of creatures<br/>To the central height<br/>To the throne of Godhead<br/>To the Father's breast<br/>Filled it with the glory<br/>Of that perfect rest</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Name Him brothers name Him<br/>With love strong as death<br/>But with awe and wonder<br/>And with bated breath<br/>He is God the Saviotr<br/>He is Christ the Lord<br/>Ever to be worshiped<br/>Trusted and adored</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>In your hearts enthrone Him<br/>There let Him subdue<br/>All that is not holy<br/>All that is not true<br/>Crown Him as your Captain<br/>In temptation's hour<br/>Let His will enfold you<br/>In its light and power</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Brothers this Lord Jesus<br/>Shall return again<br/>With His Father's glory<br/>With His angel train<br/>For all wreaths of empire<br/>Meet upon His brow<br/>And our hearts confess Him<br/>King of glory now</lines>
