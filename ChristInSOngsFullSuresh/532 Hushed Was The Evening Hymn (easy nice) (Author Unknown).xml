    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Hushed was the evening hymn<br/>The temple courts were dark<br/>The lamp was burning dim<br/>Before the sacred ark<br/>When suddenly a voice divine<br/>Rang through the silence of the shrine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The old man meek and mild<br/>The priest of Israel slept<br/>His watch the temple child<br/>The little Levite kept<br/>And what from Eli's sense was sealed<br/>The Lord to Hannah's son revealed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O give me Samuel's ear<br/>The open ear O Lord<br/>Alive and quick to hear<br/>Each whisper of Thy word<br/>Like him to answer at Thy call<br/>And to obey Thee first of all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O give me Samuel's heart<br/>A lowly heart that waits<br/>Where in Thy house Thou art<br/>Or watches at Thy gates<br/>By day and night a heart that still<br/>Moves at the breathing of Thy will</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>O give me Samuel's mind<br/>A sweet unmurmuring faith<br/>Obedient and resigned<br/>To Thee in life and death<br/>That I may read with child-like eyes<br/>Truths that are hidden from the wise</lines>
    </verse>
