    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>So precious is Jesus<br/>My Savior my King<br/>His praise all the day long<br/>With rapture I sing<br/>To Him in my weakness<br/>For strength I can cling<br/>For<br/>He is so precious to me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>For<br/>He is so precious to me<br/> Sisters (so precious to me)<br/>For<br/>He is so precious to me<br/> Sisters (so precious to me)<br/>'Tis heaven below<br/>My Redeemer to know<br/>For<br/>He is so precious to me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He stood at my heart's door<br/>'mid sunshine and rain<br/>And patiently waited<br/>An entrance to gain<br/>What shame that so long<br/>He entreated in vain<br/>For<br/>He is so precious to me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I stand on the mountain<br/>Of blessing at last<br/>No cloud in the heavens<br/>A shadow to cast<br/>His smile is upon me<br/>The valley is past<br/>For<br/>He is so precious to me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I praise Him because<br/>He appointed a place<br/>Where some day through faith<br/>In His wonderful grace<br/>I know I shall see Him<br/>Shall look on His face<br/>For<br/>He is so precious to me</lines>
