    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>A<br/>You're the Lion of Judah<br/>The Lamb who was slain<br/>You ascended to heaven<br/>And ever more will reign<br/>At the end of the age<br/>When the earth You reclaim<br/>You will gather the nations before You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>And the eyes of all men<br/>Will be fixed on the Lamb<br/>Who was crucified<br/>With wisdom and mercy and justice<br/>You'll reign at Your Father's side</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And the angels will cry<br/>Hail the Lamb<br/>Who was slain for the world<br/>Rule in pow'r<br/>And the earth will reply<br/>You shall reign<br/>As the King of all kings<br/>And the Lord of all lords</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>There's a shield in our hand<br/>And a sword at our side<br/>There's a fire in our spirits<br/>That cannot be denied<br/>'Cause the Father has told us<br/>For these You have died<br/>For the nations who gather before You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>And the ears of all men<br/>Need to hear of the Lamb<br/>Who was crucified<br/>Who descended to hell<br/>Yet was raised up to reign<br/>At His Father's side</lines>
    </verse>
