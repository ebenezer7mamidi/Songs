      <lines>D<br/><br/>Think about His love,<br/>Think about His mercy,<br/>Think about His grace,<br/>That's brought us through.</lines>

      <lines>For as high as the heavens above,<br/>So great is the measure<br/>Of our Father's love.<br/>Great is the measure<br/>Of our Father's love.</lines>

    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>How could I forget His love,<br/>How could I forget His mercy,<br/>He satisfies, He satisfies,<br/>He satisfies my desires,<br/>Great is the measure of our Father's love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Even when I've strayed away,<br/>His tender love has sought me out<br/>And found me,<br/>He found me,<br/>And carried me back home<br/>Great is the measure Of our Father's love.</lines>
