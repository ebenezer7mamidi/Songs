    <verse name="v1">

    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>At every time in every clime I found<br/>Those not with words to Christ but Spirit bound<br/>He strengthens them with might each day each hour<br/>Through them true works divine are wrought in power</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>This is the Church the Spirit hath begot<br/>Elect from every people Christ thier lot<br/>They follow where His shepherd-staff doth lead<br/>The members of this host are blessed indeed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And when on earth they meet His death to show<br/>To Him their vows of love they oft renew<br/>Some little flock will gather there or here<br/>Christ Head of all to every soul most near</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>This is the temple which our Lord approves<br/>The Church which truly honors Him and loves<br/>Whose sacrifice is on the altar bound<br/>She soon in glory will His throne surround</lines>
