    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have found life's Giver and the Prince of Life<br/>He has quenched my thirst<br/>And vanquished all my strife<br/>He my living bread became my daily meat<br/>Death has died in Him<br/>Life's triumph is complete</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In the Church what glory<br/>Far horizons glow<br/>And His Name all radiant<br/>On each brow doth show<br/>Christ doth breathe upon her<br/>As He did of old<br/>Shepherd of His sheep<br/>All gathered in one fold</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There one holy flame doth burn<br/>Within each breast<br/>By one blood redeemed in Christ<br/>They find their rest<br/>All their thirst He quenches<br/>From one living stream<br/>They in adoration<br/>Lowly worship Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>There as Bread of life<br/>Faint souls He ever feeds<br/>There each hungry soul<br/>May take whate'er he needs<br/>Lovingly He draws each soul<br/>That truly lives<br/>And in bread and wine<br/>Himself to them He gives</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Gone is all the earth-taint<br/>Through abounding grace<br/>Hear the song of triumph<br/>From the ransomed race<br/>All in glory shinning<br/>Glory not their own<br/>Gathered into oneness<br/>They approach the throne</lines>
    </verse>
