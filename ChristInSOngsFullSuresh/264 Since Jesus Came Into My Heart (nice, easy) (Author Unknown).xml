    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>What a wonderful change<br/>In my life has been wrought<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart<br/>I have light in my soul<br/>For which long I had sought<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Since Jesus came into my heart<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart<br/>Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I have ceased from my wand'ring and going astray<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart<br/>And my sins<br/>Which were many<br/>Are all washed away<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I'm possessed of a hope<br/>that is steadfast and sure<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart<br/>And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Ther's a light<br/>in the valley of death now for me<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart<br/>And the gates<br/>of the City beyond I can see<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I shall go there to dwell in that City I know<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart<br/>And I'm happy so happy as onward I go<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart</lines>
    </verse>
