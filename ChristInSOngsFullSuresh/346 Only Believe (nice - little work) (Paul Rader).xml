    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Fear not little flock He goeth ahead<br/>Your Shepherd selecteth the path you must tread<br/>The waters of Marah He'll sweeten for thee<br/>He drank all the bitter in Gethsemane</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Fear not little flock whatever your lot<br/>He enters all rooms the doors being shut<br/>He never forsakes He never is gone<br/>So count on His presence in darkness and dawn</lines>
