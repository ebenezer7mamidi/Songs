    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>D<br/><br/>Marvel not that Christ in glory<br/>All my inmost heart hath won<br/>Not a star to cheer my darkness<br/>But a light beyond the sun</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>All below lies dark and shadowed<br/>Nothing there to claim my heart<br/>Save the lonely track of sorrow<br/>Where of old He walked apart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>I was journeying in the noontide,<br/>When His light shone o'er my road;<br/>And I saw Him in that glory-<br/>Saw Him-Jesus, Son of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>All around, in noonday splendour<br/>Earthly scenes lay fair and bright<br/>But my eyes no longer see them<br/>For the glory of that light</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>Others in the summer sunshine<br/>Wearily may journey on<br/>I have seen a light from heaven<br/>Past the brightness of the sun</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>Light that knows no cloud no waning<br/>Light wherein I see His face<br/>All His love's uncounted treasures<br/>All the riches of His grace</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4a">
      <lines>Sinners it was not to Angels<br/>All this wondrous love was given<br/>But to one who scorned despised Him<br/>Scorned and hated Christ in heaven</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4b">
      <lines>From the lowest depths of evil<br/>To the throne in heaven above<br/>Thus in me He told the measure<br/>Of His free, unbounded love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5a">
      <lines>All the wonders of His glory<br/>Deeper wonders of His love<br/>How for me He won He keepeth<br/>That high place in Heaven above</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5b">
      <lines>Not a glimpse - the veil uplifted<br/>But within the veil to dwell<br/>Gazing on His face forever<br/>Hearing words unspeakable</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6a">
      <lines>I have seen the face of Jesus<br/>Tell me not of aught beside<br/>I have heard the voice of Jesus<br/>All my soul is satisfied</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6b">
      <lines>In the radiance of the glory<br/>First I saw His blessed face<br/>And forever shall that glory<br/>Be my home my dwelling place</lines>
    </verse>
