    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a holy and beautiful city<br/>Whose builder and ruler is God;<br/>John saw it descending from heaven,<br/>When Patmos in exile, he Trod;<br/>Its high, massive wall is of jasper,<br/>The city itself is pure gold,]<br/>And when my frail tent here is folded,<br/>Mine eyes shall its glory behold.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>In that bright city, pearly white city<br/>I have a mansion, an harp and a crown;<br/>Now I am watching, waiting and longing<br/>For that white city ....John saw coming down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>No sin is allowed in that city,<br/>And nothing defiling nor mean;<br/>No pain and no sickness can enter,<br/>No crape in that city is seen;<br/>Earth's sorrows and cares are forgotten,<br/>No tempter is there to annoy;<br/>No parting words ever are spoken,<br/>There's nothing to hurt and destroy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>No heartaches are known in that city,<br/>No tears ever moisten the eye;<br/>There's no disappointment in heaven,<br/>No envy and strife in the sky;<br/>The saints are all sanctified, wholly,<br/>They live in sweet harmony there;<br/>My heart now is set on that city,<br/>And some day its b lessings I'll share.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>My loved ones are gathering yonder,<br/>My friends are fast passing away;<br/>And soon I may join their bright number,<br/>And dwell in eternity's day;<br/>They're safe now in glory with Jesus,<br/>Their trials and battles are past;<br/>They overcame sin and the tempter,<br/>They've reached that fair city at last.</lines>
    </verse>
