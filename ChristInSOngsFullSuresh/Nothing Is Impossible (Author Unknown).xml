    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Nothing is impossible<br/>When you put your trust in God<br/>Nothing is impossible<br/>When you're trusting in His word<br/>Harken to the word of God to thee<br/>Is there anything to hard for Me<br/>So put your trust in God alone<br/>And rest upon His word<br/>For nothing - oh nothing<br/>Yes nothing is impossible with God</lines>
