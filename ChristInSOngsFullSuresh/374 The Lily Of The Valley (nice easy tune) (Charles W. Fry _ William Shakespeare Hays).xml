    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have found a friend in Jesus He's everything to me<br/>He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul<br/>The Lily of the Valley in Him alone I see<br/>All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole<br/>In sorrow He's my comfort in trouble He's my stay<br/>He tells me every care on Him to roll</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>He's the Lily of the Valley<br/>The bright and Morning Star<br/>He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He all my grief has taken and all my sorrows borne<br/>In temptation He's my strong and mighty tower<br/>I have all for Him forsaken and all my idols torn<br/>From my heart and now He keeps me by His power<br/>Though all the world forsake me<br/>And Satan tempts me sore<br/>Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He will never never leave me nor yet forsake me here<br/>While I live by faith and do His blessed will<br/>A wall of fire about me I've nothing now to fear<br/>With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill<br/>Then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face<br/>Where rivers of delight shall ever roll</lines>
    </verse>
