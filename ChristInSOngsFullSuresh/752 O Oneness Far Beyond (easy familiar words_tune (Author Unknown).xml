    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O oneness far beyond what words can tell<br/>Oneness all human and yet all Divine<br/>Oneness which doth all oneneses excel<br/>Which cannot be expressed by earthly sign</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>These bodies are the members of the Lord<br/>Ours and yet His for use and honor too<br/>In sympathy and love and sweet accord<br/>So one that nought that oneness can undo</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In us that Spirit dwells that dwells in Him<br/>The Spirit of the Father and the Son<br/>Though poor the temple and the glory dim<br/>Still does the Spirit claim it for His own</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O holy oneness between earth and heaven<br/>Each is the other and yet not the same<br/>Not fellowship alone to us is given<br/>But unity of nature and of name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He still the Son of God on yonder throne<br/>And we the sons of earth yet dwelling here<br/>Yet we with Him He with us truly one<br/>As if one heart were ours one home one sphere</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Upon His holy throne these members yet<br/>Shall all be seated in that day when He<br/>The head of the great unity shall sit<br/>With them to share one common royalty</lines>
    </verse>
