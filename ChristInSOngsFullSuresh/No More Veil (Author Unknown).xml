    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>1. No more veil! God bids me enter<br/> By the new and living way --<br/> Not in trembling hope I venture,<br/> Boldly I His call obey:<br/> There, with Him, my God I meet,<br/> God upon the mercy seat!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>2. In the robes of spotless whiteness,<br/> With the blood of priceless worth,<br/> He has gone into that brightness,<br/> Christ rejected from the earth --<br/> Christ accepted there on high,<br/> And in Him do I draw nigh.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>3. Oh, the welcome I have found there,<br/> God in all His love made known!<br/> Oh, the glories that surround there,<br/> Those accepted in His Son!<br/> Who can tell the depth of bliss<br/> Spoken by the Father's kiss?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>4. One with Him, O Lord, before Thee,<br/> There I live, and yet not I;<br/> Christ it is who there adores Thee:<br/> Who more dear, or who more nigh?<br/> All the Father's heart mine own --<br/> Mine and yet His Son's alone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>5. All the worth I have before Him<br/> Is the value of the Blood;<br/> I present when I adore Him,<br/> Christ the first-fruits unto God;<br/> Him with joy doth God behold,<br/> Thus is my acceptance told. <br/> by Frances Bevan</lines>
