    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How pleasant is the sound of praise<br/>It well becomes the saints of God<br/>Should we refuse our songs to raise<br/>The stones might tell our shame abroad</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For Him Who washed us in His blood<br/>Let us our sweetest songs prepare<br/>He sought us wandering far from God<br/>And now preserves us by His care</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>One string there is of sweetest tone<br/>Reserved for sinners saved by grace<br/>'Tis sacred to one class alone<br/>And touched by one peculiar race</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Though angels may with rapture see<br/>How mercy flows in Jesus' blood<br/>It is not theirs to prove as we<br/>The cleansing virtue of this flood</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Though angels praise the heavenly King<br/>And worship Him as God alone<br/>We can with exlutation sing<br/>'He wears our nature on the throne'</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Lord we adore Thy wondrous love<br/>Which brought Thee here to bleed and die<br/>That Thou lost sinners may restore<br/>And to the Father bring them nigh</lines>
    </verse>
