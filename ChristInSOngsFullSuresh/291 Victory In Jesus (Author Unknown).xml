    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>E<br/>I heard an old, old story<br/>How a Savior came from glory,<br/>How He gave His life on Calvary<br/>To save a wretch like me.<br/>I heard about His groaning,<br/>Of His precious blood's atoning,<br/>Then I repented of my sins<br/>And won the victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O, victory in Jesus,<br/>My Savior forever,<br/>He sought me and bought me<br/>With His redeeming blood.<br/>He loved me ere I knew Him<br/>And all my love is due Him.<br/>He plunged me to victory<br/>Beneath the cleansing flood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I heard about His healing,<br/>Of His cleansing pow'r revealing,<br/>How He made the lame to walk again<br/>And caused the blind to see.<br/>And then I cried dear Jesus,<br/>Come and heal my broken spirit,<br/>And somehow Jesus came and brought<br/>To me the victory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I heard about a mansion<br/>He has built for me in glory,<br/>And I heard about the streets of gold<br/>Beyond the crystal sea,<br/>About the angels singing<br/>And the old redemption story<br/>And some sweet day I'll sing up there<br/>The song of victory.</lines>
    </verse>
