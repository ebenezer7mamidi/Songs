    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>"Consider Him" let Christ thy pattern be<br/>And know that He hath apprehended thee<br/>To share His very life His power divine<br/>And in the likeness of thy Lord to shine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>"Consider Him" so shalt thou day by day<br/>Seek out the lowliest place and therein stay<br/>Content to pass away a thing of nought<br/>That glory to the Father's name be brought</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Shrink not O child of God but fearless go<br/>Down into death with Jesus thou shalt know<br/>The power of an endless life begin<br/>With glorious liberty from self and sin</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>"Consider Him" and thus thy life shall be<br/>Filled with self-sacrifice and purity<br/>God will work out in thee the pattern true<br/>And Christ's example ever keep in view</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>"Consider Him" and as you run the race<br/>Keep ever upward looking in His face<br/>And thus transformed illumined thou shalt be<br/>And Christ's own image shall be seen in thee</lines>
    </verse>
