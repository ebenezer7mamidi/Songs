    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus When conscious of thy sin<br/>Its heavy weight upon thee Its mighty pow'r with-in<br/>Then is the hour for pleading His finished work for thee<br/>Then is the time for singing His blood was shed for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus When tempted to transgress<br/>By word or look of anger Or thought of bitterness<br/>Then is the hour for claiming Thy Lord to fight for thee<br/>Then is the time for singing He doth deliver me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus When daily cares perplex<br/>And trifles seem so mighty Thy inner soul to vex<br/>Then is the hour for grasping His hand who walked the sea<br/>Then is the time for singing He makes it calm for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus When thou art wearied sore<br/>When head or hand refuses To think or labor more<br/>Then is the hour for leaning Upon the Master's breast<br/>Then is the time for singing My Savior gives me rest</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Oh, trust thyself to Jesus When thou art full of care,<br/>For loved ones still refusing Our blessed hope to share<br/>Then is the hour for trusting Thy Lord to bring them nigh<br/>Then is the time for singing He loves them<br/>more than I</lines>
