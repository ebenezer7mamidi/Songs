    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>D<br/><br/>Before I spoke a word,<br/>You were singing over me<br/>You have been so, so good to me<br/>Before I took a breath,<br/>You breathed Your life in me<br/>You have been so, so kind to me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>Oh, the overwhelming,<br/>Never-ending, reckless love of God<br/>Oh, it chases me down,<br/>Fights 'til I'm found,<br/>Leaves the ninety-nine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>I couldn't earn it,<br/>I don't deserve it,<br/>Still You give Yourself away<br/>Oh, the overwhelming,<br/>Never-ending, reckless love of God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When I was Your foe,<br/>Still Your love fought for me<br/>You have been so, so good to me<br/>When I felt no worth,<br/>You paid it all for me<br/>You have been so, so kind to me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>There's no shadow<br/>You won't light up<br/>Mountain You won't climb up<br/>Coming after me<br/>There's no wall You won't kick down<br/>Lie You won't tear down<br/>Coming after me x2</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>I couldn't earn it,<br/>I don't deserve it,<br/>Still You give Yourself away<br/>Oh, the overwhelming,<br/>Never-ending,<br/>Reckless love of God</lines>
