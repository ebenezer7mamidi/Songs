    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>C<br/><br/>Behold the Lamb<br/>Who bears our sins away<br/>Slain for us and we remember<br/>The promise made<br/>That all who come in faith<br/>Find forgiveness at the cross<br/>So we share in this Bread of Life<br/>And we drink of His sacrifice<br/>As a sign of our bonds of peace<br/>Around the table of the King</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The body of our Saviour<br/>Jesus Christ<br/>Torn for you<br/>Eat and remember<br/>The wounds that heal<br/>The death that brings us life<br/>Paid the price to make us one<br/>So we share in this Bread of Life<br/>And we drink of His sacrifice<br/>As a sign of our bonds of love<br/>Around the table of the King</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The blood that cleanses every<br/>stain of sin<br/>Shed for you<br/>Drink and remember<br/>He drained death's cup<br/>That all may enter in<br/>To receive the life of God<br/>So we share in this Bread of Life<br/>And we drink of His sacrifice<br/>As a sign of our bonds of grace<br/>Around the table of the King</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And so with thankfulness and faith we rise<br/>To respond<br/>And to remember<br/>Our call to follow in the<br/>Steps of Christ<br/>As His body here on earth<br/>As we share in His suffering<br/>We proclaim Christ will come again<br/>And we'll join in the feast of heaven<br/>Around the table of the King<br/>Around the table of the King<br/>Around the table of the King</lines>
    </verse>
