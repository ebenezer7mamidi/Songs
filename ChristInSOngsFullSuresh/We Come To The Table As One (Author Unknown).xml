    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>E<br/>We come to the table as one<br/>With our hearts so full of His mercy<br/>For the cup and bread represent His death<br/>Upon the cross of Calvary<br/>And He lives for me as He died for me<br/>He arose and is coming again<br/>Feel His presence hear as we tarry here<br/>None other could love us so</lines>
