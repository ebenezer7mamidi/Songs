    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Once our blessed Christ of beauty<br/> Was veiled off from human view;<br/> But thro' suffering death and sorrow<br/> He has rent the veil in two.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O behold the man of sorrows,<br/> O behold Him in plain view,<br/> Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,<br/> Since He rent the veil in two. <br/> Lo! He is the mighty conqueror,<br/> Since He rent the veil in two.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Yes, He is with God, the Father,<br/> Interceding there for you:<br/> For He is the Well-beloved,<br/> Since He rent the veil in two.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Holy angels bow before Him,<br/> Men of earth give praises due;<br/> For He is the mighty conqueror,<br/> Since He rent the veil in two.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Through-out time and endless ages,<br/> Heights and depths of love so true;<br/> He alone can be the giver,<br/> Since He rent the veil in two.</lines>
