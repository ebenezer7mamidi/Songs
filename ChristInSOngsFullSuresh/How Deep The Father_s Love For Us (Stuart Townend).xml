    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>E<br/><br/>How deep the Father's love for us<br/>How vast beyond all measure<br/>That He should give His only Son<br/>To make a wretch His treasure</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>How great the pain of searing loss<br/>The Father turns His face away<br/>As wounds which mar the Chosen One<br/>Bring many sons to glory</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>Behold the man upon a cross<br/>My sin upon His shoulders<br/>Ashamed I hear my mocking voice<br/>Call out among the scoffers</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>It was my sin that held Him there<br/>Until it was accomplished<br/>His dying breath has brought me life -<br/>I know that it is finished</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>I will not boast in anything<br/>No gifts no power no wisdom<br/>But I will boast in Jesus Christ<br/>His death and resurrection</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>Why should I gain from His reward<br/>I cannot give an answer<br/>But this I know with all my heart<br/>His wounds have paid my ransom</lines>
    </verse>
