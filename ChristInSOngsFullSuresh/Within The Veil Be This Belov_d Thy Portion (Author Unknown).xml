    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>1. "Within the Veil!";<br/> be this belov'd thy portion,<br/> Within the secret<br/> of thy Lord to dwell;<br/> Beholding Him,<br/> until thy face His glory,<br/> Thy life His love,<br/> thy lips His praise shall tell.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>2. "Within the Veil,"<br/> for only as thou gazest<br/> Upon the matchless beauty of His face,<br/> Canst thou become<br/> a living revelation<br/> Of His great heart of love, <br/> His untold grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>3. "Within the Veil,"<br/> His fragrance poured upon thee,<br/> Without the Veil,<br/> that fragrance shed abroad;<br/> "Within the Veil,"<br/> His hand shall tune the music<br/> Which sounds on earth<br/> the praises of Thy Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>4. "Within the Veil,"<br/> thy spirit deeply anchored,<br/> Thou walkest calm<br/> above a world of strife,<br/> "Within the Veil,"<br/> thy soul with Him united,<br/> Shall live on earth<br/> His resurrection life.</lines>
