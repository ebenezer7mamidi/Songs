    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>1. O gracious God, Thy pleasure <br/> Is in Thy Christ made known.<br/> And tells the boundless measure<br/> Of blessing for Thine own<br/> He has Thy presence entered,<br/> As Man in heav'n is known.<br/> In Him Thy glory's centered,<br/> In Him Thy purpose shown.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>2. And O what love is beaming<br/> Refulgent in that face!<br/> What blessed light is streaming<br/> From that most glorious place!<br/> Both love and light proclaiming<br/> What Thou, the Father, art,<br/> And wondrous grace revealing,<br/> With Thine own Son our part.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>3. Thou source of every blessing!<br/> Thou spring of all delight!<br/> Thy name with joy confessing<br/> Let all the saints unite!<br/> Each heart its praise outpouring<br/> To Thee all praise above,<br/> Each voice in strains adoring<br/> Re-echoes "God is love."</lines>
