    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>There is always something over<br/>When we taste our gracious Lord<br/>Every cup He fills o'er floweth<br/>His great rivers all are broad<br/>Nothing narrow, nothing stinted<br/>Ever issued from His store</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>To His own He gives full measure<br/>Running over evermore<br/>To His own He gives full measure<br/>Running over evermore</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>There is always something over<br/>When we, from our Father's hand,<br/>Take our portion with thanksgiving<br/>Praising for the path He planned<br/>Satisfaction, full and deepening<br/>Fills the soul and lights the eye</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>When the heart has trusted Jesus<br/>All its need to satisfy<br/>When the heart has trusted Jesus<br/>All its need to satisfy</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>There is always something over<br/>When we tell of all His love<br/>Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us<br/>Unscaled heights rise far above<br/>Human lips can never utter<br/>All His wondrous tenderness</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>We can only praise and wonder<br/>And His name forever bless<br/>We can only praise and wonder<br/>And His name forever bless</lines>
    </verse>
