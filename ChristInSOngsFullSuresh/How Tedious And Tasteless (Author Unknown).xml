    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>1. How tedious and tasteless the hours<br/> When Jesus no longer I see!<br/> Sweet prospects, sweet birds<br/> and sweet flow'rs,<br/> Have all lost their sweetness to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The midsummer sun shines but dim,<br/> The fields strive in vain to look gay;<br/> But when I am happy in Him<br/> December's as pleasant as May.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>2. His name yields the richest perfume,<br/> And sweeter than music His voice;<br/> His presence disperses my gloom,<br/> And makes all within me rejoice.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I should, were He always this nigh,<br/> Have nothing to wish or to fear;<br/> No mortal so happy as I;<br/> My summer would last all the year.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>3. Content with beholding His face,<br/> My all to His pleasure resigned;<br/> No changes of season or place,<br/> Would make any change in my mind.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>While blessed with a sense of His love,<br/> A palace a toy would appear;<br/> And prisons would palaces prove,<br/> If Jesus would dwell with me there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>4. My Lord, if indeed I am Thine,<br/> If Thou art my sun and my song,<br/> Say, why do I languish and pine?<br/> And why are my winters so long?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>Oh, drive these dark clouds from the sky,<br/> Thy soul-cheering presence restore;<br/> Or take me to Thee up on high,<br/> Where winter and clouds are no more.</lines>
    </verse>
