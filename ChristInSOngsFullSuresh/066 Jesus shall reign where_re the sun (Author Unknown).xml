    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>C<br/><br/>Jesus shall reign where're the sun<br/>Doth His successive journeys run<br/>His kingdom stretch from shore to shore<br/>Till moons shall wax and wane no more</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>To Him shall endless prayer be made<br/>And princes throng to crown His head<br/>His name like sweet perfume shall rise<br/>With every morning sacrifice</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>People and realms of every tongue<br/>Dwell on His love with sweetest song<br/>And infant voices shall proclaim<br/>Their early blessings on His name</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Blessings abound where're He reigns<br/>The pris'ner leaps to lose his chains<br/>The weary find eternal rest<br/>And all the sons of want are blessed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Where He displays His healing pow'r<br/>Death and the curse are known no more<br/>In Him the tribes of Adam boast<br/>More blessings than their father lost</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Let every creature rise and bring<br/>Peculiar honors to our King<br/>Angels descend with songs again<br/>And earth repeat the loud Amen</lines>
    </verse>
