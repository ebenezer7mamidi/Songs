    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>So nigh - so very nigh to God<br/>I cannot nearer be<br/>For in the person of his Son<br/>I am as near as He</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So dear so very dear to God<br/>More dear I cannot be<br/>The love wherewith He loves the Son<br/>Such is His love to me</lines>

      <lines>Why should I ever anxious be<br/>Since such a God is mine<br/>He watches o'er me night and day<br/>And tells me<br/>"Mine is thine"</lines>
