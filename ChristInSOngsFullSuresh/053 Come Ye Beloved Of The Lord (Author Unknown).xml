    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>D<br/>Come, ye beloved of the Lord,<br/>And consider all the love<br/>That the Father has Poured out on you<br/>With joyful hearts in one accord,<br/>Come and look upon the love<br/>Of the One who gave His all for you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Our God withheld Not His own Son<br/>The treasure of His heart Poured out for you<br/>Since He already gave His Son<br/>What now will He withhold From you His own</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>My friend consider Then the price<br/>That so willingly He paid<br/>To redeem and win You back to Him<br/>Consider how then you will live<br/>And just how to spend the days<br/>And the freedom He Has won for you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>With all the treasures Of the throne,<br/>Of the earth and of the sky<br/>And of the universe beyond<br/>Our Father gave instead His Son,<br/>Counting His worth far beyond<br/>All the treasures of His Kingdom home</lines>
    </verse>
