    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>D<br/><br/>Day by day and with each passing moment<br/>Strength I find to meet my trials here<br/>Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment<br/>I've no cause for worry or for fear</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>He whose heart is kind beyond all measure<br/>Give unto each day what He deems best<br/>Lovingly its part of pain and pleasure<br/>Mingling toil with peace and rest</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>Every day the Lord Himself is near me<br/>With a special mercy for each hour<br/>All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me<br/>He whose name is Counselor and Pow'r</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>The protection of His child and treasure<br/>Is a charge that on Himself He laid<br/>As your days your strength shall be in measure<br/>This the pledge to me He made</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>Help me then in every tribulation<br/>So to trust Your promises O Lord<br/>That I lose not faith's sweet consolation<br/>Offered me within Your holy Word</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>Help me Lord when toil and trouble meeting<br/>E'er to take as from a Father's hand<br/>One by one the days the moments fleeting<br/>Till I reach the promised land</lines>
    </verse>
