    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A<br/>Above all powers above all kings<br/>Above all nature and all created things<br/>Above all wisdom and all the ways of man<br/>You were here before the world began</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Above all kingdoms above all thrones<br/>Above all wonders the world has ever known<br/>Above all wealth and treasures of the earth<br/>There's no way to measure<br/>What You're worth</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Crucified laid behind a stone<br/>You lived to die rejected and alone<br/>Like a rose trampled on the ground<br/>You took the fall and thought of me<br/>Above all</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>Like a rose trampled on the ground<br/>You took the fall and thought of me<br/>Above all</lines>
