    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>D<br/>Verse 1<br/>Glorious things of thee are spoken<br/>Zion city of our God<br/>He whose word cannot be broken<br/>Formed thee for His own abode<br/>On the Rock of Ages founded<br/>What can shake thy sure repose<br/>With salvation's walls surrounded<br/>Thou may'st smile at all thy foes</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>See the streams of living waters<br/>Springing from eternal love<br/>Well supply thy sons and daughters<br/>And all fear of want remove<br/>Who can faint while such a river<br/>Ever flows their thirst t'assuage<br/>Grace which like the Lord the Giver<br/>Never fails from age to age</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Blest inhabitants of Zion<br/>Washed in the Redeemer's blood<br/>Jesus whom their souls rely on<br/>Makes them kings and priests to God<br/>'Tis His love His people raises<br/>Over self to reign as kings<br/>And as priests His solemn praises<br/>Each his thankful offering brings</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Savior since of Zion's city<br/>I thro' grace a member am<br/>Let the world deride or pity<br/>I will glory in Thy name<br/>Fading is the worldling's pleasure<br/>All its boasted pomp and show<br/>Solid joys and lasting treasures<br/>None but Zion's children know</lines>
    </verse>
