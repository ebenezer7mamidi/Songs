    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>One there is above all others<br/>Oh how He loves<br/>His is love beyond a brothers<br/>Oh how He loves<br/>Earthly friends may fail or leave us<br/>One day soothe the next day grieve us<br/>But this Friend will ne'er deceive us<br/>Oh how He loves</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>'Tis eternal life to know Him<br/>Oh how He loves<br/>Think oh think how much we owe Him<br/>Oh how He loves<br/>With His precious blood He bought us<br/>In the wilderness He sought us<br/>To His fold He safely brought us<br/>Oh how He loves</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Blessed Jesus would you know Him<br/>Oh how He loves<br/>Give yourselves entirely to Him<br/>Oh how He loves<br/>Think no longer of the morrow<br/>From the past new courage borrow<br/>Jesus carries all your sorrow<br/>Oh how He loves</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>All your sins shall be forgiven<br/>Oh how He loves<br/>Backward shall your foes be driven<br/>Oh how He loves<br/>Best of blessings He'll provide you<br/>Nought but good shall e'er betide you<br/>Safe to glory He will guide you<br/>Oh how He loves</lines>
