    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Nothing between my soul and the Savior<br/>Naught of this world's delusive dream<br/>I have renounced all sinful pleasure<br/>Jesus is mine there's nothing between</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Nothing between my soul and the Savior<br/>So that His blessed face may be seen<br/>Nothing preventing the least of His favor<br/>Keep the way clear<br/>Let nothing between</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Nothing between like worldly pleasure<br/>Habits of life though harmless they seem<br/>Must not my heart from Him ever sever<br/>He is my all there's nothing between</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Nothing between like pride or station<br/>Self or friends shall not intervene<br/>Though it may cost me much tribulation<br/>I am resolved there's nothing between</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Nothing between e'en many hard trials<br/>Though the whole world against me convene<br/>Watching with prayer and much self-denial<br/>I'll triumph at last with nothing between</lines>
    </verse>
