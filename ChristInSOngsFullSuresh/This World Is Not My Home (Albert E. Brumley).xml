    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>This world is not my home I'm just a passing thru<br/>My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue<br/>The angels beckon me from heaven's open door<br/>And I can't feel at home in this world anymore</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O Lord You know I have no friend like You<br/>If heaven's not my home then Lord what will I do<br/>The angels beckon me from heaven's open door<br/>And I can't feel at home in this world any more</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>They're all expecting me and that's one thing I know<br/>My Savior pardoned me and now I onward go<br/>I know He'll take me thru tho' I am weak and poor<br/>And I can't feel at home in this world anymore</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I have a loving Father up in gloryland<br/>I don't expect to stop until I shake His hand<br/>He's waiting now for me in heaven's open door<br/>And I can't feel at home in this world anymore</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Just up in gloryland we'll live eternally<br/>The saints on ev'ry hand are shouting victory<br/>Their song of sweetest praise<br/>Drift back from heaven's shore<br/>And I can't feel at home in this world anymore</lines>
    </verse>
