    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>"Behold I come as a thief"<br/>Oh hark to the word of His warning<br/>He cometh the Star of the Morning<br/>That heralds the light of the Sun<br/>Far spent is the night of our sorrow<br/>New comfort new hope let us borrow<br/>For soon on that glorious morrow<br/>The Great Voce shall say<br/>"It is done"<br/>For soon on that glorious morrow<br/>The Great Voice shall say<br/>"It is done"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>"Behold I come as a thief"<br/>And ere the dull world shall awaken<br/>The treasure of earth shall be taken<br/>The salt of the earth and its light<br/>The dungeons of Death shall be riven<br/>The Bride to the Bridegroom be given<br/>His jewes be ravished to heaven<br/>In silent and shadowy night</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>"Behold I come as a thief"<br/>And blessed are they that are watching<br/>That so their quick ears may be catching<br/>The sound of His step as they wait<br/>But woe unto them that are sleeping<br/>Who careless their garments are keeping<br/>The dawn on their slumbers is creeping<br/>They waken - but waken too late</lines>
