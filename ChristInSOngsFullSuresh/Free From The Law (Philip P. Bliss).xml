    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>D<br/><br/>Once for all, O sinner, receive it,<br/>Once for all, O brother, believe it;<br/>Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,<br/>Christ hath redeemed us once for all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Free from the law, O happy condition,<br/>Jesus has bled and there is remission,<br/>Cursed by the law and bruised by the fall,<br/>Grace hath redeemed us once for all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now we are free, there's no condemnation,<br/>Jesus provides a perfect salvation.<br/>"Come unto Me," O hear His sweet call,<br/>Come, and He saves us once for all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>"Children of God," O glorious calling,<br/>Surely His grace will keep us from falling;<br/>Passing from death to life at His call;<br/>Blessed salvation once for all.</lines>
