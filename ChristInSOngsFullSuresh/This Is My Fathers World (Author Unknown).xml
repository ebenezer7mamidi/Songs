    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Eb<br/>This is my Father's world<br/>And to my listening ears<br/>All nature sings and round me rings<br/>The music of the spheres<br/>This is my Father's world<br/>I rest me in the thought<br/>Of rocks and trees of skies and seas<br/>His hand the wonders wrought</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>This is my Father's world<br/>The birds their carols raise<br/>The morning light the lily white<br/>Declare their Maker's praise<br/>This is my Father's world<br/>He shines in all that's fair<br/>In the rustling grass I hear Him pass<br/>He speaks to me everywhere</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>This is my Father's world<br/>O let me ne'er forget<br/>That though the wrong seems oft so strong<br/>God is the Ruler yet<br/>This is my Father's world<br/>The battle is not done<br/>Jesus who died will be satisfied<br/>And earth and heaven be one</lines>
