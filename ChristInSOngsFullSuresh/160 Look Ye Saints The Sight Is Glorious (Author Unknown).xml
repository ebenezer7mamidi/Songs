    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>G<br/><br/>Look ye saints the sight is glorious<br/>See the Man of sorrows now<br/>From the fight return victorious<br/>Ev'ry knee to Him shall bow<br/>Crown Him crown Him<br/>Crown Him crown Him<br/>Crowns become the Victor's brow</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Crown the Saviour angels crown Him<br/>Rich the trophies Jesus brings<br/>In the seat of pow'r enthrone Him<br/>While the vault of heaven rings<br/>Crown Him crown Him<br/>Crown Him crown Him<br/>Crown the Saviour King of kings</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sinners in derision crowned Him<br/>Mocking thus the Saviour's claim<br/>Saints and angels crowd around Him<br/>Own His title praise His name<br/>Crown Him crown Him<br/>Crown Him crown Him<br/>Spread abroad the Victor's fame</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Hark those bursts of acclamation<br/>Hark those loud triumphant chords<br/>Jesus takes the highest station<br/>Oh what joy the sight affords<br/>Crown Him crown Him<br/>Crown Him crown Him<br/>King of kings and Lord of lords</lines>
