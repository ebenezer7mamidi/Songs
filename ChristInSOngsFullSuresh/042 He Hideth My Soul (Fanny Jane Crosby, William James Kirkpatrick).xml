      <lines>Bb<br/><br/>A wonderful Savior Is Jesus my Lord<br/>A wonderful Savior to me<br/>He hideth my soul<br/>In the cleft of the rock<br/>Where rivers of pleasure I see</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>He hideth my soul in The cleft of the rock<br/>That shadows a dry thirsty land<br/>He hideth my life in the depths of His love<br/>And covers me there with His hand<br/>And covers me there with His hand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">

    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock<br/>That shadows a dry thirsty land<br/>He hideth my life in the depths of His love<br/>And covers me there with His hand<br/>And covers me there with His hand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>With numberless blessings<br/>Each moment He crowns<br/>And filled with His fullness divine<br/>I sing in my rapture Oh glory to God<br/>For such a Redeemer as mine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>He hideth my soul in The cleft of the rock<br/>That shadows a dry thirsty land<br/>He hideth my life in the Depths of His love<br/>And covers me there with His hand<br/>And covers me there with His hand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When clothed in His brightness<br/>Transported I rise<br/>To meet Him in clouds of the sky<br/>His perfect salvation<br/>His wonderful love<br/>I'll shout with the millions on high</lines>
