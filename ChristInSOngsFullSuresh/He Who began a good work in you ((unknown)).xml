      <lines>He who began a good work in you<br/>He who began a good work in you<br/>Will be faithful to complete it<br/>He'll be faithful to complete it<br/>He who started the work<br/>Will be faithful to complete it in you</lines>

    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>If the struggle you're facing<br/>Is slowly replacing<br/>Your hope with despair<br/>Or the process is long<br/>And you're losing your song in the night<br/><p style="page-break-after: always;"/><br/>You can be sure<br/>That the Lord has His hand on you<br/>Safe and secure<br/>He will never abandon you<br/>You are His treasure<br/>And He finds His pleasure in you</lines>
