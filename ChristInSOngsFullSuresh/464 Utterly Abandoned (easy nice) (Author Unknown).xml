    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Utterly abandoned<br/>To The Holy Ghost<br/>Seeking all his fullness<br/>At whatever cost<br/>Cutting all the shore-lines<br/>Launching in the deep<br/>Of His mighty power<br/>Strong to save and keep</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Utterly abandonded<br/>To The Lord of all<br/>Seeking all His fullness<br/>Answering His dear call</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Utterly abandoned to The Holy Ghost<br/>Oh the sinking sinking<br/>Till the self is lost<br/>Till the vessel's emptied<br/>Broken at his feet<br/>Waiting till His filling<br/>Makes the work complete</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Utterly abandoned to the will of God<br/>Walking in the pathway<br/>That my Master trod<br/>Leaving ease and pleasure<br/>Making Him my choice<br/>Waiting for His guidance<br/>Listening for His voice</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Utterly abandoned<br/>Through eternity<br/>My will never choosing<br/>His it e'er shall be<br/>All my plans and longings<br/>Lost in His sweet will<br/>Having nothing<br/>Owning all things in Him still</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Utterly abandoned<br/>'Tis so sweet to be<br/>Captive in His love-bonds<br/>Yet so wondrous free<br/>Free from sin's dominion<br/>Free from doubt and fear<br/>Free from every worry<br/>Burden grief or care</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Utterly abandoned<br/>Oh the rest is sweet<br/>Waiting in His presence<br/>At His blessed feet<br/>Waiting for the filling<br/>Of the Host divine<br/>Who my inward parts<br/>Shall perfectly refine</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Lo His Spirit fills me<br/>With His presence sweet<br/>I in Him am blessed<br/>I in Him complete<br/>Now the light within me<br/>Never shall grow dim<br/>While abandoned ever<br/>Living unto Him</lines>
