    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who, who are these beside the chilly wave,<br/>Just on the borders of the silent grave,<br/>shouting Jesus' pow'r to save,<br/>"Washed in the blood of the Lamb"?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>Sweeping thru the gates of the New Jerusalem,<br/>"Washed in the blood of the Lamb;"<br/>Sweeping thru the gates of the New Jerusalem,<br/>"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>These, these are they who, in their youthful days,<br/>found Jesus early, and in wisdom's ways,<br/>Proved the fullness of His grace,<br/>"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>Sweeping thru the gates of the New Jerusalem,<br/>"Washed in the blood of the Lamb;"<br/>Sweeping thru the gates of the New Jerusalem,<br/>"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>These, these are they who, in affliction's woes,<br/>ever have found in Jesus calm repose,<br/>Such as from a pure heart flows,<br/>"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>These, these are they who, in the conflict dire,<br/>Boldly have stood amid the hottest fire;<br/>Jesus now says, "Come up higher!"<br/>"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Safe, safe upon the ever-shining shore,<br/>Sin, pain, and death, and sorrow, all are o'er,<br/>Happy now and evermore,<br/>"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."</lines>
