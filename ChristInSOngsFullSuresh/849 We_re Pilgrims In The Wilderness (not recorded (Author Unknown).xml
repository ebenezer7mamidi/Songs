    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We're pilgrims in the wilderness<br/>Our dwelling is a camp<br/>Created things though pleasant<br/>Now bear to us death's stamp<br/>But onward we are speeding<br/>Though often let and tried<br/>The Holy Ghost is leading<br/>Home to the Lamb His bride</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>With fellow pilgrims meeting<br/>As through the waste we roam<br/>'Tis sweet to sing together<br/>"We are not far from home"<br/>And when we've learned our lesson<br/>Our work in suff'ring done<br/>Our ever loving Father<br/>Will welcome every one</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We look to meet our brethren<br/>From every distant shore<br/>Not one will seem a stranger<br/>Though never seen before<br/>With angel hosts attending<br/>In myriads through the sky<br/>Yet 'midst them all Thou only<br/>O Lord wilt fix the eye</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lord since we sing as pilgrims<br/>O give us pilgrims' ways<br/>Low thoughts of self befitting<br/>Proclaimers of Thy praise<br/>O make us each more holy<br/>In spirit pure and meek<br/>More like to heav'nly cit'zens<br/>As more of heav'n we speak</lines>
    </verse>
