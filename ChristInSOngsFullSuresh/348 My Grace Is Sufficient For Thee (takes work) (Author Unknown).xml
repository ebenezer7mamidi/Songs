    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I'll sing of the wonderful promise<br/>That Jesus has given to me<br/>My strength is made perfect<br/>in weakness<br/>My grace is sufficient for thee<br/>And lest my poor heart should<br/>Forget it<br/>Or ever forgetful should be<br/>He still keeps repeating<br/>The promise<br/>My grace is sufficient for thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Yes over and over and over<br/>My Savior keeps saying to me<br/>My strength is made perfect in weakness<br/>My grace is sufficient for thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His grace is sufficient to save me<br/>And cleanse me from guilt and from sin<br/>Sufficient to sanctify wholly<br/>And give me His Spirit within<br/>His grace is sufficient for trials<br/>No matter how hard they may be<br/>This promise stands over against them<br/>My grace is sufficient for thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His grace is sufficient for sickness<br/>Sustaining and making me whole<br/>His grace is sufficient when sorrows<br/>Like billows roll over the soul<br/>His grace is sufficient for service<br/>It sets us from selfishness free<br/>And sends us to tell to the tried ones<br/>His grace is sufficient for thee</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>His grace is sufficient to live by<br/>And should we be summoned to die<br/>'Twill light up the valley of shadows<br/>And bear us away to Him nigh<br/>Or when we shall stand in His vict'ry<br/>And Christ in His glory shall see<br/>We'll fall at His footstool confessing<br/>Thy grace was sufficient for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>It is not our grace that's sufficient<br/>But His grace it ever must be<br/>Our graces are transient and changing<br/>His grace is unfailing as He<br/>And so I am ever repeating<br/>His wonderful promise to me<br/>My strength is made perfect in weakness<br/>My grace is sufficient for thee</lines>
