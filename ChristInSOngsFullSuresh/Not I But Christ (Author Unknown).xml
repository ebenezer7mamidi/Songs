    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>2. Not I, but Christ, my every need supplying,<br/> Not I, but Christ, my strength and health to be;<br/> Christ, only Christ, for body, soul and spirit;<br/> Christ, only Christ, live then Thy life in me.</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>3. Christ, only Christ, no idle word e'er falling;<br/> Christ, only Christ, no needless bustling sound;<br/> Christ, only Christ, no self-important bearing;<br/> Christ, only Christ, no trace of "I" be found.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>4. Not I, but Christ, to gently soothe in sorrow;<br/> Not I, but Christ, to wipe the falling tear;<br/> Not I, but Christ, to lift the weary burden;<br/> Not I, but Christ, to hush away all fear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>5. Christ, only Christ, ere long will fill my vision;<br/> Glory excelling, soon, full soon, I'll see -<br/> Christ, only Christ, my every wish fulfilling;<br/> Christ, only Christ, my all in all to be.</lines>
