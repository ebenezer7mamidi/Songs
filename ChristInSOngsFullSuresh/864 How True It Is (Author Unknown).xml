    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How true it is no heart may comprehend<br/>The glory God prepareth for His own,<br/>And what will happen when this age shall end;<br/>But yet in vision Jesus hath made known<br/>How fair and holy shall the Church descend,<br/>Lit up with light of precious jasper stone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And He shall make His church all heavenly fair,<br/>With gold and pearls, and every radiant stone,<br/>And reign in holiness and glory there,<br/>And shine as suns and stars have never shone;<br/>And He shall lead His Bride, His joy and care,<br/>With blissful singing to His Father's throne.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And then the blest communion shall have come,<br/>Of God's dear children meeting from afar;<br/>Within His burning love they blend as one,<br/>Yet each, according as His councils are,<br/>Shall have peculiar glory of his own,<br/>As one star differeth from another star.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And God is all in all in that great day,<br/>And He is their exceeding great Reward;<br/>Their stream of life, their beautiful array,<br/>Their food, their joy, their radiance, Christ the Lord;<br/>The music of their wondrous song shall say,<br/>How great the joy that passeth thought or word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>And this is that eternal life of heaven,<br/>Laid up with Christ in God, the mystery<br/>Of resurrection life which He hath given:<br/>A fount of living waters full and free;<br/>A life by which the gates of death are riven,<br/>A life which on the throne of Christ shall be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>And here in this waste wilderness begun,<br/>So soon as we believe in Christ aright,<br/>And quickened by the Spirit of the Son,<br/>Receive Him as our only life and light,<br/>As all the branches of the vine are one,<br/>So we are one forever in His sight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Now come, Lord Jesus, quickly from above,<br/>Do Thou sustain us on the desert road,<br/>An draw us after Thee by might of love,<br/>Our Fatherland art Thou, O love of God;<br/>Once safe in Thee, no more shall we remove,<br/>O Thou our everlasting sure abode.</lines>
