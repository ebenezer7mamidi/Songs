    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Still on Thy loving heart let me repose<br/>Jesus sweet Author of my joy and rest<br/>O let me pour my sorrows cares and woes<br/>Into Thy true and sympathizing breast<br/>Thy love grows ne'er cold<br/>But its pure flame<br/>Seems every day<br/>More strong and bright to glow<br/>Thy truth remains eternally the same<br/>Pure and unsullied as the mountain snow</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O what is other love compared with Thine<br/>Of such high value such eternal worth<br/>What is man's love compared with love divine<br/>Which never changes in this changing earth<br/>Love which in this cold world grows never cold<br/>Love which decays not with the world's decay<br/>Love which is young when all things else grow old<br/>Which lives when heaven and earth shall pass away</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>How little love unchangeable and fixed<br/>In this dark valley doth to man remain<br/>With what unworthy motive is it mixed<br/>How full of grief uncertainty and pain<br/>Love is the object which attracts all eyes<br/>We win it and already fear to part<br/>A thousand rivals watch to seize the prize<br/>And tear the precious idol from our heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>But Thou in spite of our offences past<br/>And those alas which still in us are found<br/>Hast loved us Jesus with a love so vast<br/>No span can reach it and no plummet sound<br/>Though the poor love we give Thee in return<br/>Should be extinguished Thine is ever true<br/>Its vestal fire eternally doth burn<br/>Though everlasting always fresh and new</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Thou who art ever ready to embrace<br/>All those who truly after Thee inquire<br/>Thou who hast promised in Thy heart a place<br/>To all who love Thee and a place desire<br/>O Lord when I am anxious and depressed<br/>And dim with tears mine eyes can hardly see<br/>O let me lean upon Thy faithful breast<br/>Rejoicing that e'en I am loved by Thee</lines>
