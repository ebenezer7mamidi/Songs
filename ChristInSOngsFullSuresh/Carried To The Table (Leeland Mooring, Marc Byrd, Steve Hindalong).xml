    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>E<br/><br/>I was carried to the table<br/>Seated where I don't belong<br/>Carried to the table<br/>Swept away by His love<br/>And I don't see my brokenness anymore<br/>When I'm seated at the table of the Lord<br/>I'm carried to the table<br/>The table of the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Wounded and forsaken<br/>I was shattered by the fall<br/>Broken and forgotten<br/>Feeling lost and all alone<br/>Summoned by the King<br/>Into the Master's courts<br/>Lifted by the Savior<br/>And cradled in His arms</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Fighting thoughts of fear<br/>Wond'ring why He called my name<br/>Am I good enough to share this cup<br/>This world has left me lame<br/>Even in my weakness<br/>The Savior called my name<br/>In His holy presence<br/>I'm healed and unashamed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>(As) I'm carried to the table<br/>Seated where I don't belong<br/>Carried to the table<br/>Swept away by His love<br/>And I don't see my brokeness anymore<br/>When I'm seated at the table of the Lord<br/>I'm carried to the table<br/>The table of the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>You carried me my God<br/>You carried me<br/>You carried me my God<br/>You carried me<br/>(REPEAT)</lines>
