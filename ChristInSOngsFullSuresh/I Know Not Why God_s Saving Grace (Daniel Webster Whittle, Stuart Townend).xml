    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I know not why God's wondrous grace<br/>To me He hath made known<br/>Nor why unworthy as I am<br/>He claimed me for His own</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>But I know whom I've believed<br/>He's able now to save<br/>What I've committed unto Him<br/>Until that final day</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I know not how this saving faith<br/>To me He did impart<br/>Nor how believing in His word<br/>Wrought peace within my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I know not how the Spirit moves<br/>Convincing men of sin<br/>Revealing Jesus through the Word<br/>Creating faith in Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I know not what of good or ill<br/>May be reserved for me<br/>Of weary ways or golden days<br/>Before His face I see</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I know not when my Lord may come<br/>I know not when or where<br/>If I shall pass the vale of death<br/>Or meet Him in the air</lines>
    </verse>
