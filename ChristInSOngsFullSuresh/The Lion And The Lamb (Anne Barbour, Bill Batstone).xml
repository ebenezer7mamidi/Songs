    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Jesus, From the Father's own right hand,<br/>Jesus, Son of God and Son of man,<br/>Jesus, Who died and rose again,<br/>Jesus, He's the Lion and the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who is He? Who's the mightiest of all<br/>Who is He? Creation trembles at His call<br/>Who is He? The lowly sacrifice,<br/>Who paid a victim's price,<br/>His name is Jesus.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who is He? With the power none can tame<br/>Who is He? When ev'ry foe would fear His name<br/>Who is He? who was humbly led away<br/>To suffer that dark day,<br/>His name is Jesus.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who is He? With the eyes that burn like fire<br/>Who is He? Oh the wonder He inspires<br/>Who is He? He bore the guilt and shame<br/>For the ones who'd gone astray,<br/>His name is Jesus.</lines>
