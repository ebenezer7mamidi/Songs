    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>LET US SING OF HIS LOVE ONCE AGAIN,<br/>Of the love that can never decay,<br/>Of the blood of the Lamb who was slain,<br/>Till we praise Him again in that day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There are cleansing and healing for all<br/>Who will wash in the life-giving blood;<br/>There is life everlasting and joy<br/>At the right hand of God through the blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Even now while we taste of His love<br/>We are filled with delight at His name;<br/>But what will it be when above<br/>We shall join in the song of the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
