    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>TO THEE, AND TO THY CHRIST, O GOD,<br/>We sing, we ever sing;<br/>For He the lonely wine-press trod<br/>our cup of joy to bring.<br/>His glorious arm the strife maintained,<br/>He marched in might from far;<br/>His robes were with the vintage stained,<br/>Red with the wine of war.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>To Thee, and to Thy Christ, O God,<br/>We sing, we ever sing;<br/>For He invaded death’s abode<br/>And robbed him of his sting.<br/>The house of dust enthralls no more,<br/>For He, the strong to save,<br/>Himself doth guard that silent door,<br/>Great Keeper of the grave.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>To Thee, and to Thy Christ, O God,<br/>We sing, we ever sing;<br/>For He hath crushed beneath His rod<br/>The world’s proud rebel king.<br/>He plunged in His imperial strength<br/>To gulfs of darkness down,<br/>He brought His trophy up at length,<br/>The foiled usurper’s crown.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>To Thee, and to Thy Christ, O God,<br/>We sing, we ever sing;<br/>For He redeemed us with His blood<br/>From every evil thing.<br/>Thy saving strength His arm upbore,<br/>The arm that set us free;<br/>Glory, O God, for evermore<br/>Be to Thy Christ and Thee.</lines>
