    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>ONE THING HAVE I DESIRED OF THE LORD,<br/>That will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house<br/>of the Lord all the days of my life;<br/>To behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in<br/>His temple; to behold the beauty of the Lord and<br/>to inquire in His temple.<br/>For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His<br/>pavilion; in the secret of His tabernacle shall He<br/>hide me; He shall set me up upon a rock.<br/>To behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in<br/>His temple; to behold the beauty of the Lord and<br/>to inquire in His temple. </lines>
