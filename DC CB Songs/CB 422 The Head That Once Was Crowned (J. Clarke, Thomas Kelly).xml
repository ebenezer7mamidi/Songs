    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The head that once was crowned<br/>Is crowned with glory now;<br/>A royal diadem adorns<br/>The mighty Victor’s brow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The highest place that heaven affords<br/>Is His by sovereign right,<br/>The King of kings, the Lord of lords,<br/>And heaven’s eternal light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The joy of all who dwell above,<br/>The joy of all below,<br/>To whom He manifests His love,<br/>And grants His name to know.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>To them the cross, with all its shame,<br/>With all its grace, is given;<br/>Their name an everlasting name,<br/>Their joy the joy of heaven.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>They suffer with their Lord below,<br/>They reign with Him above;<br/>Their profit and their joy to know<br/>The mystery of His love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>The cross He bore is life and health,<br/>Though shame and death to Him;<br/>His people’s hope, His people’s wealth,<br/>Their everlasting theme.</lines>
    </verse>
