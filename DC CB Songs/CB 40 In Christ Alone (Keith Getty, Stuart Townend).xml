    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>IN CHRIST ALONE<br/>My hope is found.<br/>He is my light, my strength, my song,<br/>This Cornerstone, this solid ground<br/>Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.<br/>What heights of love, what depths of peace,<br/>When fears are stilled, when strivings cease.<br/>My Comforter, my All in All<br/>Here in the love of Christ I stand.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In Christ alone, who took on flesh,<br/>Fullness of God in helpless babe.<br/>This gift of love and righteousness,<br/>Scorned by the ones He came to save.<br/>'Till on that cross as Jesus died,<br/>The wrath of God was satisfied.<br/>For every sin on Him was laid,<br/>Here in the death of Christ I live.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There in the ground His body lay,<br/>Light of the world by darkness slain.<br/>Then bursting forth in glorious Day,<br/>Up from the grave He rose again.<br/>And as He stands in victory,<br/>Sin's curse has lost its grip on me.<br/>For I am His and He is mine,<br/>Bought with the precious blood of Christ.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>No guilt in life, no fear in death,<br/>This is the power of Christ in me.<br/>From life's first cry to final breath<br/>Jesus commands my destiny.<br/>No power of hell, no scheme of man,<br/>Can ever pluck me from His hand.<br/>'Till He returns or calls me home<br/>Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.</lines>
