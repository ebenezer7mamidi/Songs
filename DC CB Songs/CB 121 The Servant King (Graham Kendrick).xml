    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>From heav'n You came helpless babe<br/>Enter'd our world Your glory veil'd<br/>Not to be served but to serve<br/>And give Your life that we might live</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>This is our God the Servant King<br/>He calls us now to follow Him<br/>To bring our lives as a daily offering<br/>Of worship to the Servant King</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There in the garden of tears<br/>My heavy load He chose to bear<br/>His heart with sorrow was torn<br/>Yet not my will but Yours He said</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Come see His hands and His feet<br/>The scars that speak of sacrifice<br/>Hands that flung stars into space<br/>To cruel nails<br/>Surrendered</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So let us learn how to serve<br/>And in our lives enthrone Him<br/>Each other's needs to prefer<br/>For it is Christ we're serving</lines>
    </verse>
