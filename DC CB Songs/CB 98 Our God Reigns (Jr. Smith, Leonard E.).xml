    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>A<br/><br/>How lovely on the mountains<br/>Are the feet of Him<br/>Who brings good news good news</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>Announcing peace<br/>Proclaiming news of happiness<br/>Our God reigns our God reigns</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Our God reigns our God reigns<br/>Our God reigns our God reigns</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2a">
      <lines>He had no stately form<br/>He had no majesty<br/>That we should be drawn to Him</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2b">
      <lines>He was despised<br/>And we took no account of Him<br/>Yet now He reigns with the Most High</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3a">
      <lines>It was our sin and guilt<br/>That bruised and wounded Him<br/>It was our sin that brought Him down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3b">
      <lines>When we like sheep had gone astray<br/>Our Shepherd came<br/>And on His shoulders bore our shame</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4a">
      <lines>Meek as a lamb<br/>That's led out to the slaughterhouse<br/>Dumb as a sheep before its shearer</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4b">
      <lines>His life ran down<br/>Upon the ground like pouring rain<br/>That we might be born again</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5a">
      <lines>Out of the tomb<br/>He came with grace and majesty<br/>He is alive He is alive</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5b">
      <lines>God loves us so see here<br/>His hands His feet His side<br/>Yes we know He is alive</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>He's alive, He's alive<br/>He's alive, He's alive<br/>Our God reigns our God reigns<br/>Our God reigns our God reigns</lines>
    </verse>
