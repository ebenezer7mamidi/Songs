    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>YOUR ONLY SON, NO SIN TO HIDE,<br/>But You have sent Him from Your side,<br/>To walk upon this guilty sod,<br/>And to become the Lamb of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Your Gift of Love they crucified,<br/>They laughed and scorned Him as He died,<br/>The humble King they named a fraud,<br/>And sacrificed the Lamb of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God,<br/>I love the holy Lamb of God.<br/>He washed me in His precious blood,<br/>My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I was so lost, I should have died,<br/>But You have brought me to Your side,<br/>To be led by Your staff and rod,<br/>And to be called a lamb of God.</lines>
