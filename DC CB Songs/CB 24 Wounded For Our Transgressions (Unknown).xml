    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>WOUNDED FOR OUR TRANSGRESSIONS,<br/>Bruised for our iniquities; all of our sins on Him<br/>were laid, by His stripes we are healed. He was<br/>despised and rejected, Man of Sorrows was He.<br/>How can I help but love Him? He gave His all for<br/>me. How can I help but love Him? He bore it all<br/>for me</lines>
