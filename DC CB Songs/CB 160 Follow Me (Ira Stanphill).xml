    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I TRAVELED DOWN A LONELY ROAD,<br/>And no one seemed to care. The burden on my<br/>weary back had bowed me to despair. I'd oft<br/>complain to Jesus how folks were treating me,<br/>and then I heard Him say so tenderly:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>"My feet were also weary upon the Calvary road;<br/>that cross became so heavy, I fell beneath the<br/>load. Have patience weary pilgrim, the morning I<br/>can see, just lift that cross and follow close to Me."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I've worked so hard for Jesus, I'd oft complain and<br/>say, "I've sacrificed a lot of things to walk this<br/>narrow way. I gave up fame and fortune, Lord, I'm<br/>worth a lot to Thee," and then I heard Him gently<br/>say to me:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>"I left the throne of glory and counted it but loss;<br/>My hands were nailed in anger upon that cruel<br/>cross. So now let's make that journey with your<br/>hand safe in Mine. Just lift that cross and follow<br/>close to Me."</lines>
