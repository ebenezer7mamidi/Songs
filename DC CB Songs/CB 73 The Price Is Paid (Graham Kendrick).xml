    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>THE PRICE IS PAID,<br/>Come let us enter in<br/>To all that Jesus died to make our own.<br/>For every sin more than enough He gave,<br/>And bought our freedom from each guilty stain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>The price is paid, Alleluia,<br/>Amazing grace, so strong and sure;<br/>And so with all my heart,<br/>My life in every part, I live to thank You<br/>For the price You paid.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The price is paid, see Satan flee away;<br/>For Jesus crucified destroys his power.<br/>No more to pay, let accusation cease,<br/>In Christ there is no condemnation now.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The price is paid, and by that scourging cruel<br/>He took our sicknesses as if His own.<br/>And by His wounds, His body broken there,<br/>His healing touch may now by faith be known.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The price is paid, ‘Worthy the Lamb’ we cry,<br/>Eternity shall never cease His praise.<br/>The church of Christ shall rule upon the earth,<br/>In Jesus’ name we have authority.</lines>
    </verse>
