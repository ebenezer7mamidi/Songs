    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>BEHOLD WHAT MANNER OF MAN IS THIS,<br/>Who stands 'twixt God and man?<br/>His eyes are as a flame of fire,<br/>His fan is in His hand.<br/>John saw Him in the seven churches<br/>As the Sun in brilliancy.<br/>Behold what manner of man is this?<br/>What manner of man is He?<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>He's the Lord of Glory, He is the great I Am,<br/>The Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.<br/>His name is Wonderful, the Prince of Peace is He.<br/>He's the Everlasting Father, throughout eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Behold what manner of man is this,<br/>Who spake to the woman at the well?<br/>Everlasting life I'll give to thee,<br/>Far richer than man can tell.<br/>And whosoever shall drink of the well<br/>Shall live eternally.<br/>Behold what manner of man is this?<br/>What manner of man is He?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Behold what manner of man is this,<br/>Who spake to the maimed and halt?<br/>He says, "Thy sins be forgiven thee,<br/>Take up thy bed and walk."<br/>He stands as the mighty Healer now,<br/>And He cries, "Come unto Me!"<br/>Behold what manner of man is this?<br/>What manner of man is He?</lines>
