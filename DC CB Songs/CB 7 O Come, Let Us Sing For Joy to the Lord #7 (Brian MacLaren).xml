    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O COME, LET US SING FOR JOY TO THE<br/>LORD.<br/>Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation.<br/>Let us come before His presence with<br/>thanksgiving. Let us shout joyfully to Him with<br/>psalms.<br/>O come, let us worship and bow down. Let us<br/>kneel before the Lord our Maker. For He is our<br/>God, and we are the people of His pasture and<br/>the sheep of His hand.</lines>
