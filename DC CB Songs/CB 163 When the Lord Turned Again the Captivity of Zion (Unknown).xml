    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>WHEN THE LORD TURNED AGAIN THE<br/>CAPTIVITY OF ZION,<br/>We were like them that dream. Then was our<br/>mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with<br/>singing; then said they among the heathen, the<br/>Lord hath done great things for them.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof<br/>we are glad. Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as<br/>the streams in the south. They that sow in tears<br/>shall reap in joy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious<br/>seed, shall doubtless come again, shall doubtless<br/>come again, shall doubtless come again with<br/>rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.</lines>
