    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE UNTO THE LORD,<br/>All ye, all ye lands.<br/>Serve the Lord, the Lord with gladness.<br/>Come before His presence with singing.<br/>Know ye that the Lord He is God.<br/>It is He that hath made us,<br/>And not we ourselves;<br/>we are His people and the sheep of His pasture.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Enter into His gates with thanksgiving,<br/>And into His courts with praise.<br/>Be thankful unto Him,<br/>And bless His holy name.<br/>For the Lord, the Lord is good.<br/>His mercy is everlasting;<br/>And His truth, His truth endureth,<br/>Endureth to all generations.</lines>
