    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>SON OF ALL GLORY<br/>Robed in the light,<br/>Put off His mantle, drawn by man's plight.<br/>Entered the battle, taking on the form of man.<br/>Drawn by His love for us all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Father of glory released His Son,<br/>That He might finish the task begun.<br/>He laid His life down exchanged for our sins,<br/>Drawn by His love for us all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who then can separate us from Him,<br/>Jesus the victor, death lost its sting.<br/>I yield the title to all that I am<br/>Reborn to live for my King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Father in heaven, grant us to see,<br/>The day we follow as He followed Thee.<br/>Clothed in white raiment cleansed by the Lamb.<br/>Reborn the Bride of the King.</lines>
