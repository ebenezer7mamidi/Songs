    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR HOLINESS<br/>When I gaze into Your lovely face,<br/>When the things that surround me become<br/>shadows in the light of You.<br/>When I've found the joy of reaching Your heart,<br/>When Your will becomes enthroned in my life,<br/>When the things that surround me become<br/>shadows in the light of You,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I worship You, I worship You,<br/>The reason I live is to worship You.<br/>(Repeat)</lines>
