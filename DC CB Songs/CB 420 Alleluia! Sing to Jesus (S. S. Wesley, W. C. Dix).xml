      <lines>ALLELUIA! SING TO JESUS,<br/>His the scepter, His the throne;<br/>Alleluia! His the triumph,<br/>His the victory alone.<br/>Hark, the songs of holy Zion<br/>Thunder like a mighty flood.<br/>Jesus out of every nation<br/>Hath redeemed us by His blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Alleluia! Not as orphans<br/>Are we left in sorrow now;<br/>Alleluia! He is near us,<br/>Faith believes, nor questions how,<br/>Though the clouds from sight received Him<br/>When the forty days were o’er,<br/>Shall our hearts forget His promise,<br/>“I am with you evermore”?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Alleluia! Bread of heaven,<br/>Thou on earth our food, our stay;<br/>Alleluia! Here the sinful<br/>Flee to Thee from day to day.<br/>Intercessor, Friend of sinners,<br/>Earth’s Redeemer, plead for me,<br/>Where the songs of all the sinless<br/>Sweep across the crystal sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Alleluia! Sing to Jesus,<br/>His the scepter, His the throne;<br/>Alleluia! His the triumph,<br/>His the victory alone.<br/>Hark, the songs of holy Zion<br/>Thunder like a mighty flood:<br/>Jesus out of every nation,<br/>Hath redeemed us by His blood.</lines>
