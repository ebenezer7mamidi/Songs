    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>THINK ABOUT HIS LOVE<br/>(echo)<br/>Think about His mercy, (echo)<br/>Think about His grace that's brought us through.<br/>For as high as the heavens above,<br/>So great is the measure of our Father's love,<br/>Great is the measure of our Father's love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How could I forget His love<br/>How could I forget His mercy.<br/>He satisfies, He satisfies, He satisfies my desires.<br/>Great is the measure of our Father's love.<br/>(Repeat first verse)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Even when I've strayed away,<br/>His tender love has sought me out;<br/>And found me, He found me, and carried me back<br/>home. Great is the measure of our Father's love.<br/>(Repeat first verse)</lines>
    </verse>
