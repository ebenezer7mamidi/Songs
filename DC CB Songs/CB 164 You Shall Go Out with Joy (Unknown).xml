    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>YOU SHALL GO OUT WITH JOY,<br/>And be led forth with peace; the mountains and<br/>the hills shall break forth before you.<br/>There'll be shouts of joy, and all the trees of the<br/>field shall clap, shall clap their hands. And all the<br/>trees of the field shall clap their hands, trees of<br/>the field shall clap their hands, trees of the field<br/>shall clap their hands, as you go out with joy.</lines>
