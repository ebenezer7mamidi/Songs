    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus will lead me, wonderful Savior!<br/>Jesus will lead me, I cannot tell where;<br/>But I will follow, through joy or sorrow,<br/>Sunshine or tempest, sweet peace or despair.</lines>

    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Jesus will crown me, wonderful Savior!<br/>Jesus will crown me, I cannot tell when;<br/>White throne of splendor hail I with gladness,<br/>Crowned â€˜mid the plaudits of angels and men.</lines>
