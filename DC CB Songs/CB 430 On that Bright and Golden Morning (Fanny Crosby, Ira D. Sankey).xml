    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>ON THAT BRIGHT AND GOLDEN MORNING<br/>When the Son of Man shall come,<br/>And the radiance of His glory we shall see;<br/>When from every clime and nation<br/>He shall call His people home,<br/>What a gathering of the ransomed that will be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>What a gathering! What a gathering!<br/>What a gathering of the ransomed<br/>In the summer land of love!<br/>What a gathering! What a gathering!<br/>Of the ransomed in that happy home above!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When the blest who sleep in Jesus<br/>At His bidding shall arise<br/>From the silence of the grave, and from the sea;<br/>And with bodies all celestial<br/>They shall meet Him in the skies,<br/>What a gathering and rejoicing there will be!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When our eyes behold the City,<br/>With its many mansions bright,<br/>And its river, calm and restful, flowing free;<br/>When the friends that death has parted<br/>Shall in bliss again unite,<br/>What a gathering and a greeting there will be!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh, the King is surely coming,<br/>And the time is drawing nigh,<br/>When the blessed day of promise we shall see;<br/>Then the changing in a moment,<br/>In the twinkling of an eye,<br/>And for ever in His presence we shall be.</lines>
