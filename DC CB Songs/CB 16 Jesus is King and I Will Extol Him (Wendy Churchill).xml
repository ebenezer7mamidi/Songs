    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>JESUS IS KING AND I WILL EXTOL HIM.<br/>Give Him the glory, and honor His name.<br/>He reigns on high, enthroned in the heavens,<br/>Word of the Father, exalted for us.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We have a hope that is steadfast and certain,<br/>Gone through the curtain and touching the throne.<br/>We have a Priest who is there interceding,<br/>Pouring His grace on our lives day by day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We come to Him, our Priest and Apostle,<br/>Clothed in His glory and bearing His name,<br/>Laying our lives with gladness before Him;<br/>Filled with His Spirit we worship the King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O Holy One, our hearts do adore You;<br/>Thrilled with Your goodness we give You our<br/>praise.<br/>Angels in light with worship surround Him,<br/>Jesus, our Savior, forever the same. </lines>
